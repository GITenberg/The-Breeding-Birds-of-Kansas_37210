<div class="caption2">INTRODUCTION</div>

<p>The breeding avifauna of Kansas has received intermittent attention
from zoologists for about 75 years. Summary statements, usually
concerning all birds of the state, have been published by Goss (1891),
Long (1940), Goodrich (1941), Tordoff (1956) and Johnston (1960). All
but the first dealt with the breeding birds chiefly in passing, and
none was concerned primarily with habitat distributions and temporal
characteristics of Kansan birds. The present work treats mainly
certain temporal relationships of breeding birds in Kansas, but also
geographic distribution, habitat preferences, and zoogeographic
relationships to the extent necessary for a useful discussion of
temporal breeding phenomena.</p>

<p>Information on breeding of some of the 176 species of birds known to
breed in Kansas is relatively good, on a few is almost non-existent,
and on most is variously incomplete. It is nevertheless possible to
make meaningful statements about many aspects of the breeding biology
and distribution of most species of Kansan birds;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
we can take stock, as it were, of available information and assess the
outstanding avenues of profitable future work. In the accounts of species
below, the information given is for the species as it occurs in Kansas,
unless it is otherwise stated. For the various subsections analyzing
biology and distribution, only information taken in Kansas is used,
and for this reason the analyses are made on about half the species
breeding in the state. An enormous amount of observational effort has
been expended by several dozen people in order that suitable data
about breeding birds of Kansas be available; all persons who have
contributed in any way are listed in the section on acknowledgments,
following the accounts of species.</p>

<p>Kansas has been described topographically, climatically, and otherwise
ecologically many times in the recent past; the reader is referred to
the excellent account by Cockrum (1952), which treats these matters
from the viewpoint of a zoologist. For present purposes it will
suffice to mention the following characteristics of Kansas as a place
lived in by birds.</p>

<p>Topographically, Kansas is an inclined plane having an elevation of
about 4100 feet in the northwest and about 700 feet in the southeast.
West of approximately 97&deg; W longitude, the topography is gently
rolling, low hills or flat plain; to the east the Flint Hills extend
in a nearly north to south direction, and to the east of these heavily
weathered, grassy hills is a lower-lying but more heavily dissected
country, hills of which show no great differences in elevation from
surrounding flatland.</p>

<p>The vegetation of eastern Kansas comingles with that of the western
edge of the North American deciduous forest; a mosaic of true forest,
woodland remnants, and tall-grass prairie occupies this area east of
the Flint Hills. From these hills west the prairie grassland today has
riparian woodland along watercourses; the prairie is composed of
proportionally more and more short-grass elements to the west and
tall-grass elements to the east.</p>

<p>Climate has a dominating influence on the vegetational elements
sketched above. Mean annual rainfall is 20 inches or less in western
sectors and increases to about 40 inches in the extreme eastern border
areas. Mean monthly temperatures run from 25&deg;F. or 30&deg;F. in winter to
80&deg;F. or 90&deg;F. in summer. The northwestern edges of Caribbean Gulf
warm air masses regularly reach northward only to the vicinity of
Doniphan County, in northeastern Kansas, and extend southwestward into
west-central Oklahoma; these wet frontal systems are usually
dissipated along the line indicated by masses of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
arctic air, sometimes in spectacular fashion. The regular recurrence of
warm gulf air is responsible for the characteristically high relative
humidity in summer over eastern Kansas and it has an ameliorating effect
on winter climate in this region. Almost immediately to the north in
Nebraska and to the west in the high plains, summers are dryer and
winters are notably more severe. The breeding distributions of some
species of birds fairly closely approximate the distribution of these
warm air masses; these examples are noted where appropriate below.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a href="#TOC">[^TOC]</a></span>
<div class="caption2">DISTRIBUTION OF BIRDS IN KANSAS</div>


<p>Birds breeding in Kansas are taxonomically, ecologically, and
distributionally diverse. Such diversity is to be expected, in view of
the mid-continental position of the State. Characteristics of
insularity, owing to barriers to dispersal and movement, tend to be
lacking in the makeup of the avifauna here. The State is not, of
course, uniformly inhabited by all 176 species (<a href="#Tbl_1">Table 1</a>) of breeding
birds; most species vary in numbers from one place to another, and
some are restricted to a fraction of the State. Variations in numbers
and in absolute occurrence are chiefly a reflection of restriction or
absence of certain plant formations, which is to say habitats; the
analysis to follow is thus organized mainly around an examination of
gross habitat-types and the birds found in them in Kansas.</p>

<p>Four major habitat-types can be seen in looking at the distribution of
the breeding avifauna of Kansas. These are woodland, grassland,
limnic, and xeric scrub plant formations. A little more than half the
breeding birds of Kansas live in woodland habitats, about one-fifth in
limnic habitats, about one-eighth in grassland habitats, and less than
two per cent in scrub habitats; this leaves some 6.4 per cent of the
breeding avifauna unanalyzed (<a href="#Tbl_2">Table 2</a>).</p>

<div class="caption3">Woodland Habitats</div>

<p>One hundred one species of Kansan birds are woodland species (tables <a href="#Tbl_1">1</a>
and <a href="#Tbl_2">2</a>). The analysis of Udvardy (1958) showed woodland birds to be the
largest single avifaunal element in North America, with 38 per cent of
North American birds relegated to it. It is likewise the largest
element in the Kansan avifauna, representing 58 per cent of Kansan
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
birds. Although woodland makes up a relatively small fraction of the
vegetational complexes in Kansas, a large number of habitats exist in
what woodland is present. An even larger number of possible woodland
habitats is clearly missing, however, because the 101 Kansan species
actually represent but 44 per cent of all woodland birds in North
America, according to Udvardy's analysis. Broad-leaved, deciduous
woodlands in Kansas are of restricted horizontal and vertical
stratification. More complex deciduous forest associations and all
coniferous forest associations are absent from the State.</p>

<p>Using Mayr's (1946) breakdown of geographical origin of the North
American bird fauna, about 53 per cent of the woodland passerine birds
in Kansas are of "North American" origin, 22 per cent are of
"Eurasian" origin, and 14 per cent are of "South American" origin
(<a href="#Tbl_3">Table 3</a>). These figures for Kansas are commensurate with those found
for other geographic districts at the same latitude in North America
(Mayr, 1946:28). Other characteristics of woodland birds are
summarized in tables <a href="#Tbl_4">4</a> and <a href="#Tbl_5">5</a>.</p>

<div class="caption3">Limnic Habitats</div>

<p>Of Kansan birds, 36 species (20 per cent) prefer limnic habitats
(<a href="#Tbl_1">Table 1</a>). Udvardy found this group to represent 15 per cent of the
North American avifauna. Kansas is not notably satisfactory for limnic
species, and only 38 per cent of the total North American limnic
avifauna is present in the State.</p>

<p>Thirty-one species of limnic birds belong to families that Mayr (1946)
considered to be unanalyzable as to their geographic origin; of the

but it represents 72 per cent of the grassland birds of North America;
grassland habitats abound in Kansas. Only 5.3 per cent of all North
American birds are grassland species (Udvardy, 1958).</p>

<p>About 56 per cent of these birds are of North American stocks, nine
per cent of Eurasian stocks, and three per cent of South American
stocks. The percentage of North American species is the greatest for
any habitat group here considered. Other characteristics of grassland

<div class="caption3">Western Limits Reached in Kansas</div>

<p>Thirty-one species (tables <a href="#Tbl_6">6</a> and <a href="#Tbl_7">7</a>) reach the western limits of their
distribution somewhere in Kansas. Most of these limits are in eastern
Kansas, and coincide with the gradual disappearance of the eastern
deciduous forest formation. Twenty-nine species are woodland birds,
and few of these seem to find satisfactory conditions in the riparian
woods extending out through western Kansas. The Wood Thrush is the one
woodland species that has been found nesting in the west (Decatur
County; Wolfe, 1961). Descriptively, therefore, the dominant reason
for the existence of distributional limits in at least 28 of these
birds is the lack of suitable woodland in western Kansas; these 28 are
the largest single group reaching distributional limits in the State.
Many other eastern woodland birds occur in western Kansas along
riparian woodlands, as is mentioned below.</p>

<p>Two species showing western limits in Kansas are characteristic of
grassland habitats; the Eastern Meadowlark seems to disappear with
absence of moist or bottomland prairie grassland and the Henslow
Sparrow may be limited westerly by disappearance of tall-grass
prairie.</p>

<p>The Short-billed Marsh Wren, a marginal limnic species, reaches its
southwesterly mid-continental breeding limits in northeastern
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
Kansas. The species breeds in Kansas in two or three years of each ten, in
summers having unusually high humidity.</p>
<br />

<div class="caption3">Northern Limits Reached in Kansas</div>

<p>Fourteen species (tables <a href="#Tbl_6">6</a> and <a href="#Tbl_7">7</a>) reach their northern distributional
limits in Kansas. Eight of these are birds of woodland habitats, but
of these only the Carolina Chickadee is a species of the eastern
deciduous woodlands; the other seven live in less mesic woodland.
Three of these species (Chuck-will's-Widow, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher
and Painted Bunting) have breeding ranges that suggest the
northwesterly occurrences of summer humid warm air masses ("gulf
fronts") and this environmental feature perhaps is of major importance
for these birds, as it is also for the vegetational substratum in
which the birds live.</p>

<p>The Lesser Prairie Chicken and the Cassin Sparrow are the two birds of
grasslands that are limited northerly in Kansas. Xeric, sandy
grassland is chiefly limited to the southwestern quarter of Kansas,
and this limitation is perhaps of major significance to these two
species. The Scaled Quail and Roadrunner tend to drop out as the xeric
"desert scrub" conditions of the southwest drop out in Kansas.</p>

<p>Eleven species (tables <a href="#Tbl_6">6</a> and <a href="#Tbl_7">7</a>) reach their eastern distributional

<div class="caption3">Influence of Riparian Woodland</div>

<p>Although the largest single element of the Kansan avifauna that
reaches distributional limits in Kansas is made up of birds of the
eastern deciduous forest, several species of the eastern woodlands are
present in Kansas along the east-west river drainages in riparian
woodland; the species are listed in <a href="#Tbl_8">Table 8</a>. Twenty-one kinds are
involved if we include the Cooper Hawk, Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Orchard
Oriole, Summer Tanager, Rufous-sided Towhee, and Chipping Sparrow, all
of which breed farther to the west but are present in western Kansas
only along river drainages. This leaves 15 species of eastern
deciduous woodlands that occur west in Kansas along
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
riparian woodland (<i>versus</i> 30 species that drop out chiefly where
eastern woodland drops out). These 15 species are about one-third of all
woodland birds in western Kansas. Riparian woodland does not seem to afford
first-rate habitat for most of the eastern woodland species that do
occur; breeding density seems to be much lower than in well-situated
eastern woodland.</p>

<p>The importance of these linear woodlands as avenues for gene-flow
between eastern and western populations, especially of species-pairs
(grosbeaks, flickers, orioles, and buntings), is obviously great.
Likewise significant is the existence of these alleys for dispersal
from the west of certain species (for instance, the Black-billed
Magpie and the Scrub Jay) into new but potentially suitable areas.</p>

<div class="caption2">BREEDING SEASONS</div>

<div class="caption2">Introduction</div>

<p>An examination of breeding seasons or schedules is properly undertaken
at several levels. The fundamental description of variation in
breeding schedules must itself be detailed in several ways and beyond
this there are causal factors needing examination. The material below
is a summary of the information on breeding schedules of birds in
Kansas, treated descriptively and analytically in ways now thought to
be of use.</p>

<p>Almost any event in actual reproductive activity has been used in the
following report; nestbuilding, egg-laying, incubation, brooding of
young, feeding of young out of the nest are considered to be of equal
status. To any such event days are added or subtracted from the date
of observation so as to yield the date when the clutch under
consideration was completed.</p>

<p>Such corrected dates can be used in making histograms that show the
time of primary breeding activity, or the "egg-season." All such
schedules are generalizations; data are used for a species from any
year of observation, whether 50 years ago or less than one year ago.
One advantage of such procedure is that averages and modes are thus
more nearly representative of the basic temporal adaptations of the
species involved, as is explained below.</p>

<p>When information on the schedule of a species from one year is lumped
with information from another year or other years, two (and ordinarily
more than two) frequency distributions are used to make one frequency
distribution. The great advantage here is that the frequency
distribution composed of two or more frequency distributions is more
stable than any one of its components. Second, the peak of the season,
the mode of egg-laying, is represented more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span> broadly than it would
have been for any one year alone. Third, the extremes of breeding
activity are fairly shown as of minute frequency and thus of limited
importance, which would not be true if just one year were graphed. All
these considerations combine to support the idea that general schedules
in fact represent the basic temporal adaptations of a
species much better than schedules for one year only.</p>
<br />
<br />

<a name="VARIATION_IN_BREEDING_SEASONS"></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a href="#TOC">[^TOC]</a></span>
<div class="caption2">Variation in Breeding Seasons</div>

<p>In the chronology of breeding seasons of birds, there are three basic
variables: time at which seasons begin, time at which seasons end, and
time in which the major breeding effort occurs. These variables have
been examined in one population through time (Lack, 1947; Snow, 1955;
Johnston, 1956), in several populations of many species over wide
geographic ranges (Baker, 1938; Moreau, 1950; Davis, 1953), and in
several populations of one species (Lack, <i>loc. cit.</i>; Paynter, 1954;
Johnston, 1954). The analysis below is concerned with breeding of many
kinds of birds of an arbitrarily defined area and with the influence
of certain ecologic and zoogeographic factors on the breeding seasons
for those several species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Influence of Seasonal Status.</span>&mdash;Here we are interested in whether a
species is broadly resident or migrant in Kansas; 70 species are
available for analysis.</p>
<br />


<div class="caption3">Resident Species</div>

<p>Twenty-four species, furnishing 875 records of breeding, are here
considered to be resident birds in northeastern Kansas. These species
are Cooper Hawk, Red-tailed Hawk, Prairie Chicken, Bobwhite, Rock
Dove, Great Horned Owl, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Hairy Woodpecker,
Downy Woodpecker, Horned Lark, Blue Jay, Common Crow, Black-billed
Magpie, Black-capped Chickadee, Tufted Titmouse, Carolina Wren, Bewick
Wren, Mockingbird, Eastern Bluebird, Loggerhead Shrike, Starling,
House Sparrow, Eastern Meadowlark, and Cardinal. The distribution of
completed clutches (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>) runs from mid-January to mid-September,
with a modal period in the first third of May. Conspicuous breeding
activity occurs from mid-April to the first third of June.</p>
<br />


<div class="caption3">Migrant Species</div>

<p>Forty-six species, furnishing 2,522 records of breeding, are
considered to be migrant in northeastern Kansas. These species are
Great Blue Heron, Green Heron, Swainson Hawk, American Coot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
Killdeer, Upland Plover, American Avocet, Least Tern, Yellow-billed
Cuckoo, Black-billed Cuckoo, Burrowing Owl, Common Nighthawk, Chimney
Swift, Red-headed Woodpecker, Eastern Kingbird, Western Kingbird,
Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Great Crested Flycatcher, Eastern Phoebe,
Eastern Wood Pewee, Bank Swallow, Rough-winged Swallow, Barn Swallow,
Purple Martin, Brown Thrasher, Catbird, House Wren, Robin, Wood
Thrush, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, Bell Vireo, Warbling Vireo,
Prothonotary Warbler, Yellow Warbler, Chat, Western Meadowlark,
Red-winged Blackbird, Orchard Oriole, Baltimore Oriole, Common
Grackle, Black-headed Grosbeak, Indigo Bunting, Dickcissel, Lark
Sparrow, and Field Sparrow. The distribution of completed clutches
runs from mid-March to the first third of September, with a modal
period of egg-laying in the first third of June (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). Conspicuous
breeding activity occurs from the first third of May to the last third
of June.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Influence of Dominant Foraging Adaptation.</span>&mdash;Five categories here
considered reflect broad foraging adaptation: woodland species, taking
invertebrate foods in the breeding season from woody vegetation or the
soil within wooded habitats; grassland species, taking invertebrate
foods in the breeding season from within grassland situations; limnic
species, foraging within marshy or aquatic habitats; aerial species,
foraging on aerial arthropods; raptors, feeding on vertebrates or
large insects.</p>
<br />


<div class="caption3">Raptors</div>

<p>Six species, furnishing 174 records of breeding, are here considered,
as follows: Cooper Hawk, Red-tailed Hawk, Swainson Hawk, Great Horned
Owl, Burrowing Owl, and Loggerhead Shrike. The distribution of
clutches (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>) runs from mid-January to the first third of July and
is bimodal. One period of egg-laying occurs in mid-February and a
second in the last third of April. Such a distribution indicates that
two basically independent groups of birds are being considered. The
first peak of laying reflects activities of the large raptors, and the
second peak is that of the insectivorous Burrowing Owl and Loggerhead
Shrike. The peak for these two birds is most nearly coincident with
that for grassland species, a category to which the Burrowing Owl
might well be relegated.</p>

</div>
<br />


<div class="caption3">Limnic Species</div>

<p>Six species, the Great Blue Heron, Green Heron, American Coot,
American Avocet, Least Tern and Red-winged Blackbird, furnish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
264 records of breeding. The distribution of clutches (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>) runs
from mid-March to the last third of July and is bimodal. This is
another heterogeneous assemblage of birds; the Great Blue Heron is
responsible for the first peak, in the first third of April. The other
five species, however, show fair consistency and their peak of
egg-laying almost coincides with peaks for aerial foragers, woodland
species, and migrants, considered elsewhere in this section.</p>
<br />


<div class="caption3">Grassland Species</div>

<p>Ten species, Greater Prairie Chicken, Bobwhite, Killdeer, Upland
Plover, Horned Lark, Starling, Eastern Meadowlark, Western Meadowlark,
Common Grackle, and Dickcissel, furnish 404 records of breeding
activity. The distribution of clutches (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>) runs from the first of
March to mid-September. The peak of egg-laying occurs in the first
third of May. This is coincident with the peak for resident species,
perhaps a reflection of the fact that half the species in the present
category are residents in northeastern Kansas.</p>
<br />


<div class="caption3">Woodland Species</div>

<p>In this category are included species characteristic of woodland edge.
Thirty-four species, furnishing 1,882 records of breeding, are here
treated: Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Black-billed Cuckoo, "flicker"
(includes birds thought to be relatively pure red-shafted, pure
yellow-shafted, as well as clear hybrids), Red-bellied Woodpecker,
Red-headed Woodpecker, Hairy Woodpecker, Downy Woodpecker, Blue Jay,
Black-billed Magpie, Common Crow, Black-capped Chickadee, Tufted
Titmouse, Carolina Wren, Bewick Wren, House Wren, Brown Thrasher,
Catbird, Mockingbird, Robin, Wood Thrush, Eastern Bluebird, Blue-gray
Gnatcatcher, Bell Vireo, Warbling Vireo, Prothonotary Warbler, Yellow
Warbler, Chat, Orchard Oriole, Baltimore Oriole, Cardinal,
Black-headed Grosbeak, Indigo Bunting, Lark Sparrow, and Field
Sparrow. The distribution of clutches runs from the first third of
March to mid-September (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). The modal period for completed
clutches is the first third of June. Conspicuous breeding activity
occurs from the first third of May to mid-June. The distribution of
the season in time is almost identical with that for migrant species,
reflecting the large number of migrant species in woodland habitats in
Kansas.</p>
<br />


<div class="caption3">Aerial Foragers</div>

<p>Twelve species, Common Nighthawk, Chimney Swift, Eastern Kingbird,
Western Kingbird, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Great Crested Flycatcher,
Eastern Phoebe, Eastern Wood Pewee, Bank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span> Swallow, Rough-winged
Swallow, Barn Swallow, and Purple Martin, furnish 587 records of
breeding. The distribution of clutches (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>) extends from the last
third of March to the first third of August, and the modal date of
clutches is in the first third of June. Conspicuous breeding activity
occurs from the end of May to the end of June. The peak of nesting
essentially coincides with that characteristic of migrants.</p>
<br />
<br />

<a name="ZOOGEOGRAPHIC_CATEGORIES"></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a href="#TOC">[^TOC]</a></span>
<div class="caption2">Zoogeographic Categories</div>

<p>Three categories of Mayr (1946) are of use in analyzing trends in
breeding schedules of birds in Kansas. These categories of presumed
ultimate evolutionary origin are the "Old World Element," the "North
American Element," and the "South American Element." Not always have I
agreed with Mayr's assignments of species to these categories, and
such differences are noted. There is some obvious overlap between
these categories and those discussed previously.</p>
<br />

<div class="caption3">Old World Element</div>

<p>Eighteen species, Red-tailed Hawk, Rock Dove, Great Horned Owl, Hairy
Woodpecker, Downy Woodpecker, Black-billed Magpie, Common Crow,
Black-capped Chickadee, Tufted Titmouse, Robin, Loggerhead Shrike,
Starling, House Sparrow, Bank Swallow, Barn Swallow, and Blue-gray
Gnatcatcher, furnish 969 records of breeding (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). Species for
which I have records but which are not here listed are the Blue Jay
and the Wood Thrush, both of which I consider to be better placed with
the North American Element. The distribution of completed clutches
runs from mid-January to the first third of August, and shows a
tendency toward bimodality. The second, smaller peak is due to the
inclusion of relatively large samples of three migrant species (Robin,
Bank Swallow, and Barn Swallow). The timing of the breeding seasons of
these three species is in every respect like that of most other
migrants; if they are removed from the present sample the bimodality
disappears, indicating an increase in homogeneity of the unit.</p>
<br />

<div class="caption3">North American Element</div>

<p>Twenty-six species, Greater Prairie Chicken, Bobwhite, "flicker,"
Rough-winged Swallow, Purple Martin, Blue Jay, Carolina Wren, Bewick
Wren, House Wren, Mockingbird, Catbird, Brown Thrasher, Wood Thrush,
Bell Vireo, Warbling Vireo, Prothonotary Warbler, Yellow Warbler,
Chat, Eastern Meadowlark, Western Meadowlark, Red-winged Blackbird,
Orchard Oriole, Baltimore Oriole, Common
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
Grackle, Lark Sparrow, and Field Sparrow, furnish 1,233 records of breeding
(<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). The distribution of completed clutches runs
from the first third of April to the first third of September. The modal
date for completion of clutches is June 1.</p>
<br />

<div class="caption3">South American Element</div>

<p>Twelve species, Eastern Kingbird, Western Kingbird, Scissor-tailed
Flycatcher, Great Crested Flycatcher, Yellow-bellied Flycatcher,
Traill Flycatcher, Eastern Wood Pewee, Eastern Phoebe, Cardinal,
Black-headed Grosbeak, Rose-breasted Grosbeak, and Indigo Bunting,
furnish 552 records of breeding (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). The curve representing this
summary schedule is bimodal, wholly as a result of including the
Eastern Phoebe and the Cardinal with this sample.</p>
<br />

<div class="caption3">Relationship of Schedules to Temperature and Precipitation</div>

<p>In outlining the ten categories above, attention has been given to
certain similarities and differences in the frequency distributions. A
slightly more refined way of comparing the frequency distributions is
to relate them to other, seasonally variable phenomena. Figure 1 shows
the frequency distributions of egg-laying of these ten categories of
birds in terms of the regular changes in mean temperature and mean
precipitation characteristic of the environments in which these birds
live in the breeding season.</p>

<p><a href="#Tbl_9">Table 9</a> shows that there are two basic groups of birds according to
peak of egg-laying and incidence of precipitation; raptors, birds of
Eurasian origin, resident birds, and birds of grassland habitats tend
to have their peaks of egg-laying prior to the peak of spring-summer
rains, and the other six categories tend to have their peaks of
egg-laying occur in the time of spring-summer rains. Regarding
temperature, there are four categories of birds; these are evident in
the table.</p>

<p>Some of the correspondences deserve comment. Residents and grassland
species both breed before the rains come and before mean temperatures
reach 70&deg;F., and this correspondence probably results from most of the
grassland species being residents. Contrariwise, most birds of
Eurasian stocks are residents, but not all residents are of such
stocks; the two groups are discrete when mean temperature at breeding
is considered. Woodland birds, aerial foragers, and birds of South
American evolutionary stocks breed after temperatures surpass 70&deg;F. on
the average. Almost all such species are migrants, but many migrants
have different temporal characteristics, and the categories thus are
shown to be discrete on the basis of temperature at time of breeding.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
The change through spring and summer of temperature and precipitation
delineates the inception and waxing of the growing season of
vegetation and of the subsequent arthropod populations, on which most
of the birds feed in the breeding season. The temporal characteristics
of growing seasons in North America have been treated by Hopkins
(1938) and have been related to timing of breeding seasons in Song
Sparrows (<i>Passerella melodia</i>) of the Pacific coast of North America
(Johnston, 1954).</p>
<br />
<br />

<a name="SIGNIFICANCE_OF_PHYLOGENY"></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a href="#TOC">[^TOC]</a></span>
<div class="caption2">Significance of Phylogeny to Breeding Schedules</div>

<p>Evidence from a variety of sources demonstrates that timing of
breeding seasons is either broadly or specifically
genetically-determined. For some species in some situations major
environmental variables are paramount in regulating timing of
breeding, but in others the innate, regulatory "clock" is less closely
tied to conspicuous exogenous stimuli. The work by Miller (1955a,
1955b, 1960) with several species of <i>Zonotrichia</i> strongly indicates
that endogenous timing is most important for these birds, and there is
ecological evidence for Song Sparrows that supports the same point
(Johnston, 1954, 1956). It is, in any event, possible to treat
breeding schedules as species-specific characters, for any one
geographic area.</p>

<p>In an attempt to relate a breeding schedule to previous ancestral
modes, that is by extension to phylogeny, it is necessary to know how
often ancestral adaptations can persist in the face of necessity to
adapt to present environmental conditions. It is necessary to know how
conservative or how immediately plastic breeding schedules can be. The
disadvantage of using available information about configurations of
breeding seasons (as shown in Figs. 3 to 9) is that it is extremely
difficult to compare visually at one time more than six or eight
histograms as to the trenchant similarities and differences regarding
times of inception and cessation of breeding, and time of peak
egg-laying. It is possible, however, to reduce these three variables
to one variable (as described below), which allows the necessary
comparisons to be made more easily; this variable may be called the
<i>breeding index</i>.</p>
<br />

<div class="caption3">Calculation of Breeding Index</div>

<p>The chronological year is broken roughly into ten-day intervals
numbered 1 to 36. The histogram describing the temporal occurrence of
the breeding season of a species in our area usually will lie within
intervals 7 to 25. The modal date for completion of clutches is given
a value corresponding to the number of ten-day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span> intervals beyond
interval 7 (March 1-10); this describes the modal variable. The date
of completion of 83 per cent of all clutches is given a value
corresponding to the number of ten-day intervals it lies from interval
11 (April 11-20); this describes the 83 per cent variable (and is a
measure of the length of the season in terms of its inception). The
breeding index can then be calculated as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
I &#61; <span class="smcap">X</span><sub>m</sub> + <span class="smcap">X</span><sub>sd</sub>,<br />
<table class="text_lf" summary="formula variables">
<tr>
  <td>where:</td>
  <td>I is the breeding index,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td><span class="smcap">X</span><sub>m</sub> is the modal variable, and</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td><span class="smcap">X</span><sub>sd</sub> is the 83 per cent variable.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>This is obviously an arbitrary scheme to gain a simple measure of
beginning, peak, and end of a breeding season. Other schemes could be
devised whereby different absolute values would be involved, but the
relative nature of the results would be preserved. The values under
the present system for 73 species of Kansan birds run from -5 to +22;
early modal dates and cessation to breeding give low values, late
dates high values.</p>

<p>Within this framework there are other, presumably subordinate, factors
that influence the values of breeding indices, as follows:</p>

<p>1. Migratory habit. Any migrant tends to arrive on breeding grounds
relatively late, hence migrants ordinarily have higher index values
than do residents.</p>

<p>2. Colonial breeding. The strong synchrony of colonially-breeding
species tends to move the modal egg-date toward the time of inception
of breeding; as a result colonially-breeding species probably have
lower index values than they would have if not colonial.</p>

<p>3. Single-broodedness. Species having only one brood per season tend
to have shorter seasons than double-brooded species, and their index
values tend to be lower than those of double-brooded species.</p>

<p>Migratory habit unquestionably has considerable influence on index
values in some species. It is not, however, as important as other
matters, such as the condition of the food substratum or sensitivity
of the pituitary-gonadal mechanism, in determining timing and mode of
breeding activity. The schedule of the Purple Martin is the extreme
example showing that time of spring arrival on breeding grounds is not
necessarily related to time of inception of breeding. It should be
emphasized that the factors leading to northward migratory movement
may be involved in timing of the annual gonadal and reproductive
cycle.</p>

<p>Figure 2 presents a graphic summary of values of breeding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
indices for many groups of Kansan birds. The values for species of a
given family have been linked by a horizontal line. The length of this
line is proportional to the degree to which the index values for the
species concerned resemble one another. Note that the plottings for the
Picidae, Corvidae, Turdidae, Tyrannidae, and Icteridae each contain
one point that is well-removed from a cluster of points. This can be
interpreted as a measure of the frequency of adaptive plasticity
versus adaptive conservatism; five of the 24 plottings show a plastic
character, 19 a conservative. There are 26 plottings that show
temporal consistency, all of which may be taken as evidence of
adaptive (or relictual) conservatism of the species in question.</p>

<div class="caption3">Conclusion</div>

<p>Such patterns of breeding chronology support the idea that seasonal
response to the necessities of breeding is conservative more often
than plastic. Most students of breeding schedules believe that since
these are highly adaptive, they must also be capable of flexibility to
meet variable environments within the range of the species. Such
thinking receives support when different geographic localities are
considered for one species (Johnston, 1954), or when specific features
of a special environment are considered (see Miller, 1960; Johnston,
1956).</p>

<p>Yet, if one, relatively restricted locality is considered, as in the
present study, evidence of a conservative characteristic in breeding
schedules can be detected. This conservatism may result from the
historic genetic "burden" of the species; that is to say, previous
adaptive peaks may in part be evident in the matrix of contemporary
adaptation. Adaptive relicts of morphological nature have been many
times documented, but characteristics associated with seasonality and
timing schedules have not.</p>

<p>In any event, genetic relationships are evident in the configuration
of breeding seasons of many species here treated. Thus, any
consideration of variation in breeding schedules must be sensitive to
the limits, whether broad or restricting, that the heritage of a
species sets on its present chronological adaptation.</p>

<a name="REGULATION_OF_BREEDING_SCHEDULES"></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a href="#TOC">[^TOC]</a></span>
<div class="caption2">Regulation of Breeding Schedules</div>

<p>Regulation of breeding schedules in birds always involves some
exogenous, environmental timing or triggering mechanism. Broad limits
to functional reproductive activity seem to be set by the
photoperiod&mdash;neuroendocrine system. This basic, predominately
extra-equatorial, regulator can be ignored by temperate-zone species
only if they possess chronological adaptation to special, aperiodic
environmental conditions, as does the Red Crossbill (<i>Loxia
curvirostra</i>; see McCabe and McCabe, 1933; H. B. Tordoff, ms.), for
which the chief consideration seems to be availability of conifer
seeds. Environmental phonomena otherwise known to trigger breeding
activity include rainfall (Davis, 1953; Williamson, 1956), presence of
suitable nesting material (Marshall and Disney, 1957; Lehrman, 1958),
temperature (Nice, 1937), and presence of a mate (Lehrman, Brody, and
Wortis, 1961). Such regulators, or environmental oscillators, are the
"phasing factors" of the physiologic clock that dictate the temporal
occurrence of primary reproductive activity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
None of the regulators mentioned above has been specifically
investigated for any Kansan bird, but it is reasonable to suppose
that, in these temperate-zone species, the photoperiod is the most
important general phasing factor in seasonal breeding. Although
gonadal response and seasonal restriction of breeding are set by
the photoperiod, specific temporal relationships are dictated by more
immediate environmental variables.</p>

<p><a href="#Tbl_9">Table 9</a>, as already noted, shows the gross relationships between
certain groups of birds, certain arbitrary indicators of seasonal
temperature-humidity conditions bearing significantly on the growing
season, and occurrence in time of peak of egg-laying by the birds
involved. Some species and groups of Kansan birds breed chiefly under
cool-dry environmental conditions, and some under warm-wet
environmental conditions. Within each of these categories some
variation occurs. Thus, raptors and boreally-adapted species (the
Eurasian zoogeographic element) breed under cool conditions prior to
rains, and residents and grassland species breed under slightly warmer
conditions prior to rains; limnic species, species derived from North
American evolutionary stocks, and migrants tend to breed in the cooler
segment of the warm-wet period, and woodland birds, aerial foragers,
and species derived from South American evolutionary stocks tend to
breed in the warmer segment of the warm-wet period.</p>

<p>So much, then, for relationships between birds and their environments
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
at a descriptive level. It would be useful at this point to examine
how environmental variables relate to timing of breeding. Certain
independent lines of investigation indicate that birds have a
well-developed internal timing device; most convincing is the work of
Schmidt-Koenig (1960) and the others who have shown that the
endogenous clock of birds can be shifted in its periodicity forward or
backward in time. This and much other evidence (see Brown, 1960)
indicate that many fundamental periodic regulators are extrinsic to
the animal; it is thus permissible for present purposes to consider
any expression of variation in timing as dependent on environmental
oscillators. It is not hereby meant to ignore the fact that
differential responses to dominant environmental variables occur
within a species, indicating endogenous control over timing of
breeding. The work by Miller (1960:518) with three populations of the
White-crowned Sparrow, revealing innately different responses to
vernal photoperiodic increase, is especially important in this regard.
For the moment, however, we may consider exogenous controls only.</p>

<p>Any exogenous control, or environmental variable, can be looked on
simply as a timing oscillator. Such variables show regular or
irregular periodic activity, and the independent actions as a whole
result in the more-or-less variable annual schedule of breeding for
any species at any one place. It would seem that some oscillators are
linked to one another, but there is a real question concerning the
over-all degree to which linkage is present. It is significant that
frequency distributions of breeding activity of various species and
groups of birds take on the shape of a skewed normal curve. The more
information is added to such distributions, the more nearly they
approach being wholly normal, with irregularities tending to
disappear. This kind of response itself is evidence that most of the
variables influencing the distribution are not mutually linked.</p>

<p>This conclusion is warranted if we examine what would happen to
frequency distributions if the variables or oscillators regulating
timing were linked. The frequency distribution of breeding activity in
birds is described by a nonlinear curve (a normal distribution is
nonlinear). Let us assume that each of the environmental variables is
a nonlinear oscillator, as is probable. A set of nonlinear oscillators
mutually entrained or coupled and operating with reference to a given
phenomenon would result in that phenomenon being described by a
frequency distribution much more stable than if it were regulated by
any one oscillator alone. However, the frequency distribution of a set
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
of coupled nonlinear oscillators is non-normal (Wiener, 1958).</p>

<p>We do not obtain such distributions in describing breeding activity,
so we may say that the oscillators regulating such activity are not
coupled. Present distribution, habitat preference, residency status,
foraging adaptation, previous zoogeographic history, and relicts of
ancestral adaptation, all bear on the character of the breeding
schedule of any bird species. The emphasis above on multiple
regulation of breeding schedules conceivably reflects the true
picture, but any such emphasis is made at the expense of taking one
factor as basic, or reducing the many to one, in order to manufacture
simplicity.</p>

<a name="ACCOUNTS_OF_SPECIES"></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a href="#TOC">[^TOC]</a></span>
<div class="caption2">ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES</div>

<p>In each account below information is given concerning status, habitat,
geographic distribution, seasonal occurrence, schedule of egg-laying,
number of eggs laid, and sites of nests, as these pertain to Kansas,
unless otherwise stated. The ways in which some of these points were
elucidated are as follows.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;Breeding schedule. Frequency distributions of egg-laying in time
are calculated on the basis of dates of completed clutches, as
described earlier (p. 588). Any event in the series of actions of
nesting&mdash;nestbuilding, egg-laying, incubation, brooding, feeding young
out of nests&mdash;can be manipulated by adding or subtracting days to or
from the date of record to yield the probable date of completion of
the clutch. The resulting data are grouped into class intervals of ten
days. Extreme dates here given for egg-laying may be as much as nine
days off in accuracy, but the error does not often exceed five days.
Extreme dates indicated here may be taken as actual or predicted
extremes. The raw data used are on file at the Museum of Natural
History and are available for use by any qualified individual.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Dates of occurrence. First and last annual occurrences in the
State for migrant species are indicated by both a range of dates and a
median date. Twenty to 30 dates of first observation in spring are
available for most of the common species, and 10 to 20 dates of last
observation in autumn are at hand for such species. The median dates,
earlier than and subsequent to which an equal number of observations
are available, are reliable indicators of the dates on which a species
is likely to be seen first in the State in an average year.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Clutch-size. Information on number of eggs is given for each
species according to the mode, followed by the mean, the range, and
the size of the sample.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
4.&mdash;Distribution in Kansas. Information on distribution in the
breeding season within the borders of Kansas is given in accounts
below chiefly by reference to one or more counties of the State.
Location of counties can be made by referring to Figure 10.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Pied-billed Grebe</b>: <i>Podilymbus podiceps podiceps</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This is
a common but local summer resident, in and on ponds, marshes, streams,
ditches, and lakes. The species can be seen in the State at any time,
but usually arrives in the period March 1 to April 13 (the median is
March 21), and departs southward in the period October 13 to November
18 (the median is October 24).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Nineteen records of breeding span the period May
1 to June 30; the modal date for egg-laying is May 15.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 to 10 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are floating masses of marsh vegetation (cattail, smartweed,
duckweed, filamentous green algae, and the like), kept green on top by
addition of fresh material, in or at the edge of emergent marsh
vegetation.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Double-crested Cormorant</b>: <i>Phalacrocorax auritus auritus</i>
(Lesson).&mdash;This is a transient, but has been found nesting on one
occasion in Barton County (Tordoff, 1956:311).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs were laid in July and August in the one
known nesting effort.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 2 to 4 eggs (Davie, 1898).</p>

<p class="species"><b>Great Blue Heron</b>: <i>Ardea herodias</i> Linnaeus.&mdash;This common summer
resident nests in tall trees along rivers, streams, and marshes. The
sector of greatest abundance is the Flint Hills. <i>A. h. herodias</i>
Linnaeus occurs in extreme northeastern Kansas, <i>A. h. wardi</i> Ridgway
breeds in southeastern Kansas, and <i>A. h. treganzai</i> Court breeds in
western Kansas; specimens showing intermediate morphology have been
taken from the central part of the State. Occurrence in time,
exclusive of the few that overwinter in Kansas, is shown in <a href="#Tbl_10">Table 10</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Seventy-seven records of breeding span the
period March 1 to April 30 (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>); the modal date of egg-laying is
April 5.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.4, 3-6; 36).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in crotches of sycamore, cottonwood, elm, hackberry, oak,
and walnut, from 30 to 60 feet high; the average height is about 40 feet.</p>

resident around wooded streams and ponds in eastern Kansas. Nesting
records and specimens taken in the breeding season come from east of
stations in Pottawatomie, Coffey, and Woodson counties. Most nesting
records at present come from the Marais des Cygnes Wildlife Refuge,
Linn County. The species is present in the State from March 5 to
December 8.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eleven records of breeding span the period March
21 to May 10; the peak of egg-laying is probably in mid-April. The
present data are inadequate for showing the full span of the breeding
season.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is around 15 eggs, varying from 10 to
23 in the sample at hand.</p>

surface.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Swallow-tailed Kite</b>: <i>Elanoides forficatus forficatus</i>
(Linnaeus).&mdash;This kite was formerly a summer resident in eastern
Kansas; it no longer occurs as a breeding species.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;In Kansas the season seemed to occur relatively
late in the year for a raptor; eggs were laid in May, so far as is
known.</p>

<p>Nests are placed in tops of trees.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Mississippi Kite</b>: <i>Ictinia misisippiensis</i> (Wilson).&mdash;This is a common
summer resident in southern Kansas, west to Morton County. Specimens
taken in the breeding season and records of nesting come from south of
stations in Grant, Barton, Harvey, and Douglas counties; the present
center of abundance is in Meade, Clark, Comanche, Barber, and Harper
counties.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Seven records of breeding span the period April
20 to June 10; the peak of egg-laying seems to be in the first week of
May.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 2 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed about 35 feet high (from 25 to 50 feet) in
cottonwood, willow, elm, black locust, and the like.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Sharp-shinned Hawk</b>: <i>Accipiter striatus velox</i> (Wilson).&mdash;This rare
summer resident apparently occurs only in the eastern part. The two
nesting records are from Cloud and Pottawatomie counties.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;The information at hand suggests the birds lay
in April and May.</p>

oak, and other trees.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Red-tailed Hawk</b>: <i>Buteo jamaicensis borealis</i> (Gmelin).&mdash;This is a
common resident east of the 100th meridian; to the west numbers are
reduced, although the species is by no means unusual in western
Kansas. Red-tails probably always were uncommon in western Kansas;
Wolfe (1961) reports that they were "very rare as a nesting species"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>in Decatur County shortly after the turn of the 20th Century.

<p class="species"><b>Broad-winged Hawk</b>: <i>Buteo platypterus platypterus</i> (Vieillot).&mdash;This
is an uncommon summer resident in eastern Kansas, in swampy woodland.
Specimens taken in the breeding season and nesting records are from
Shawnee, Douglas, Leavenworth, and Johnson counties; there are several
nesting records from Missouri in the bottomlands just across the river
from Wyandotte County Kansas. Occurrence in time is listed in <a href="#Tbl_11">Table 11</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Four records of nesting span the period April 21
to May 30, but it is likely that the egg-season is longer than this.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 3 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed high in deciduous trees.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Swainson Hawk</b>: <i>Buteo swainsoni</i> Bonaparte.&mdash;This is a common summer
resident in prairie grassland with open groves and scattered trees.
Records of breeding are available from all parts of the State, but are
least numerous from the southeastern quarter. Occurrence in time is
listed in <a href="#Tbl_11">Table 11</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Sixteen records of breeding span the period
April 11 to June 10; the modal date for completion of clutches is
April 25.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 2 eggs (2.4, 2-3; 5).</p>

<p>Nests are placed about 35 feet high, actually ranging from 12 to 75
feet, in cottonwood, elm, willow, and honey locust. Occasionally nests
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
are placed on ledges in cliffs.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Ferruginous Hawk</b>: <i>Buteo regalis</i>
(Gray).&mdash;This is an uncommon resident in western Kansas, in grassland
with scattered trees. Records of nesting and specimens taken in the
breeding season come from Wallace, Hamilton, Gove, Logan, and Finney
counties.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Five records of breeding span the period March
11 to April 30.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 3 eggs (3.3, 3-4; 4).</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the ground surface on small cliffs or promontories
or low (six to 10 feet) in small trees such as osage orange,
cottonwood, and mulberry.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Marsh Hawk</b>: <i>Circus cyaneus hudsonius</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This is a local
resident in grassland throughout Kansas. Most records of breeding come
from east of the Flint Hills, but it is not certain that the few
records from the west actually reflect a low density of Marsh Hawks in
that area.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Sixteen records of breeding span the period
April 11 to May 20; the modal date for egg-laying is May 5.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (5.2, 3-7; 14).</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the ground surface in grassy cover.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Peregrine Falcon</b>: <i>Falco peregrinus anatum</i> Bonaparte.&mdash;This falcon
nested, perhaps regularly but clearly in small numbers, in Kansas
prior to the 20th Century. The best documented breeding occurrence was
at Neosho Falls, Woodson County (Goss, 1891:283).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs were recorded as being laid in February and
March.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 3 or 4 eggs (Davie, 1898).</p>

<p>Nests are placed relatively high on cliffs and in trees; at Neosho
Falls these birds used open cavities 50 to 60 feet high in sycamores.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Sparrow Hawk</b>: <i>Falco sparverius sparverius</i> Linnaeus.&mdash;This is a
common resident throughout Kansas, in parkland and woodland edge.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Thirteen records of egg-laying span the period
March 21 to May 20; the modal date of laying is not evident in this
sample but it probably falls around April 10.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.2, 3-5; 5).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in cavities about 16 feet high, actually 12 to 30
feet, in cottonwood, ash, maple, Purple Martin "houses," and human
dwellings.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Greater Prairie Chicken</b>: <i>Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus</i>
(Brewster).&mdash;This is a locally common resident in eastern Kansas, in
and about bluestem prairie grassland, and is local in the northwest in
undisturbed plains grassland. Wolfe (1961) reports that the species
was common in Decatur County shortly after the turn of the Century,
but that it became rare by 1914.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Twenty-one records of breeding span the period
May 1 to June 10 (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>); the modal date for laying is May 5. The
sample indicates an abrupt inception to laying of eggs, and this may
be a reflection of timing characteristic of behavior at leks, or
booming grounds.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 12 eggs (11.7, 9-15; 17).</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the surface of the ground in bluestem grassland or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
plains bunchgrass, usually under cover of prairie grasses and forbs.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Lesser Prairie Chicken</b>: <i>Tympanuchus pallidicinctus</i> (Ridgway).&mdash;This
is a local resident in sandy grassland in southwestern Kansas.
Distribution is to the west and south of Pawnee County.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;There is no information on timing of the
breeding season in Kansas.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is thought to be near that of the
Greater Prairie Chicken. Vic Housholder (MS) observed a hen with ten
chicks ten miles south of Dodge City, Ford County, on June 1, 1955.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Bobwhite</b>: <i>Colinus virginianus</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This is a common resident
in the east, but is local in western Kansas; occurrence is in broken
woodland and other edge habitats. <i>C. v. virginianus</i> (Linnaeus) is
found northeast of stations in Nemaha, Douglas, and Miami counties,
and <i>C. v. taylori</i> Lincoln is found in the remainder of the State.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Twenty-four records of breeding span the period
May 1 to September 20 (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>); the modal date for first clutches is
May 25. The long period of egg-laying after May probably includes both
renesting efforts and true second nestings.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 13 eggs (12.8, 8-21; 22); in
the present sample 16 eggs was the most frequent number.</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the surface of the ground at bases of bunch
grasses, saplings, trees, or posts, under cover of prairie grasses,
forbs, or small woody plants.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Scaled Quail</b>: <i>Callipepla squamata pallida</i> Brewster.&mdash;This is a
locally common resident in southwestern Kansas, chiefly west of Clark
County and south of the Arkansas River; preferred habitat seems to be
in open, sandy prairie.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid at least in May; the egg-season in
Kansas is unlikely to be so prolonged as that of the Bobwhite; among
other factors involved, the Scaled Quail in Kansas is at a northern
extreme of its distribution, where suboptimal environmental conditions
may occur relatively frequently.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is around 10 to 12 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the ground surface under woody or herbaceous
cover.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Ring-necked Pheasant</b>: <i>Phasianus colchicus</i> Linnaeus.&mdash;This introduced
resident is common in western Kansas, is local and uncommon in the
east, and is found in agricultural land with scattered woody
vegetation.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid at least in May.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 10 to 12 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the surface of the ground in woody or herbaceous
cover.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Wild Turkey</b>: <i>Meleagris gallopavo</i> Linnaeus.&mdash;Turkeys formerly
occurred as common residents in flood-plain woodland in eastern Kansas,
and their distribution extended through the west in riparian woodland.
Present population in eastern and southern sectors are partly the
result of introductions of birds from Missouri by humans in the 1950s.
Turkeys in southern Kansas are also present owing to natural dispersal
along the Arkansas and Medicine Lodge rivers of birds native to and
introduced into Oklahoma. No specimens of turkeys presently found in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>
Kansas are available for examination but these birds probably are
referable to <i>M. g. silvestris</i> Vieillot, the trinomen applied to
turkeys in Missouri and northeastern Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Turkeys from southern Texas recently have been liberated at several
localities in southern Nebraska; turkeys seen in extreme northern
Kansas are thus probably of these stocks. The name <i>M. g. intermedia</i>
Sennett is applicable to these birds.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;No information is available on the egg-season in
Kansas; turkeys have nested in southern Kansas within recent years,
however.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is perhaps 12 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the surface of the ground, usually well-concealed
under woody vegetation.</p>

<p class="species"><b>King Rail</b>: <i>Rallus elegans elegans</i> Audubon.&mdash;This summer resident is
locally common in marshlands. Nesting records or adults taken in the
breeding season are from Cheyenne, Meade, Pratt, Stafford, Cloud,
Riley, Douglas, Anderson, and Allen counties. Dates of arrival in
spring are recorded from April 7 to April 28; the median date is April
18. Departure in autumn is possibly as early as September in the
north, but four records are in the period October 12 to November 25.
The species occasionally can be found in winter (Douglas County,
December 28, 1915).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Fourteen records of breeding span the period May
1 to July 20; the modal date for egg-laying is June 5.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 10 eggs (9 to 12; 4 records).</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the surface of the ground, under grassy or woody
cover.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Virginia Rail</b>: <i>Rallus limicola limicola</i> Vieillot.&mdash;This is an
uncommon summer resident, presumably throughout the State. The one
breeding record is from Morton County (May 24, 1950; Graber and
Graber, 1951). Dates of spring arrival are from April 19 to May 18;
dates of last observation in autumn are within the period September 1
to October 30. A few birds overwinter in the southern part of the
State (Meade County, December and January).</p>

<p><i>Breeding season.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid probably in May and June.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Six to 12 eggs are laid (Davie, 1898).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in emergent aquatic plants, near the surface of the
water.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Sora</b>: <i>Porzana carolina</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This is an uncommon summer
resident in marshland. Nesting records or specimens taken in the
breeding season come from Finney, Barton, Jefferson, Douglas, and
Miami counties. First dates of observation in spring are from April 11
to May 9 (the median is May 1); dates when last observed in autumn are
from September 30 to November 9 (the median is October 18).</p>

<p class="species"><b>Rock Dove</b>: <i>Columba livia</i> Gmelin.&mdash;This species was introduced into
North America by man from European stocks of semi-domesticated
ancestry. "Pigeons" now are feral around towns and farms, and
cliffsides in the west, and are locally common permanent residents
throughout the State.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid in every month of the year. The
main season of breeding is spring, and this is depicted in Figure 4;
the 26 records of breeding by feral birds are from January 11 to June

<p class="species"><b>Mourning Dove</b>: <i>Zenaidura macroura marginella</i> (Woodhouse).&mdash;This is
a common summer resident throughout the State, in open country and woodland
edge. The species is also present in winter in much reduced numbers,
and many are transient in periods of migration. The time of greatest abundance
is from March to November. Doves of extreme eastern Kansas have
by some workers been referred to the subspecies <i>Z. m. carolinensis</i> (Linnaeus);
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>
specimens at the Museum of Natural History indicate that these doves are
best regarded as members of populations of intermediate subspecific, or
morphologic, affinities, and that they are satisfactorily included within <i>Z. m.
marginella</i>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Numerous (983) records of egg-laying from north-central
Kansas are from April 1 to September 10; the modal date for laying
is May 15. Forty-three records of breeding from northeastern Kansas span
the period March 21 to August 10; the modal date of laying is May 15.
These samples are depicted in Figure 4.</p>

<p>Both sets of data are shown here to illustrate some of the differences
between large and small samples of heterogeneous data. The small sample
tends to be incomplete both early and late in the season, and the mode tends
to be conspicuous. Yet, the modes for the two samples coincide. Also, the
data from the north-central sector indicate that egg-laying in March would
be found less than once in 983 records, but the small sample from the northeast
includes one record for March. Such an instance doubtless reflects, at
least in part, the fact that the two geographic sectors have different environmental
conditions, but it is likely that the instance also partly reflects the
unpredictable nature of sampling.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Doves lay two eggs. About one per cent of all nests
have 3 eggs, but it is not known for any of these whether one or two females
were responsible.</p>

<p>Nests are placed in a wide variety of plants, or on the ground. The
commonest plants are those used most frequently; in north-central Kansas
one-third of all nests are placed in osage orange trees, but in the northeast
elms are most frequently used. Nestsites are from zero to 15 feet high.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Yellow-billed Cuckoo</b>: <i>Coccyzus americanus americanus</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This
is a common summer resident in riparian and second-growth habitats throughout

and May 22 (the median is May 12), and nine dates of last observation in
autumn run from September 13 to October 12 (the median is September 23).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Sixty-nine records of egg-laying span the period May
11 to September 10 (<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>); the modal date of laying is June 5.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 3 eggs (3.1, 2-5; 54).</p>

dates of first arrival in spring are from May 7 to May 30 (the median is May
19), and four dates of last observed occurrence in autumn are between September
4 and October 7 (the average is September 18).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Seventeen records of egg-laying are between May 21
and August 10; the mode is at June 5.</p>

pendant branches, 10 to 20 feet high.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Belted Kingfisher</b>: <i>Megaceryle alcyon alcyon</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This summer
resident is common throughout the State in streamside and lakeside
habitats. Timing of arrival and departure of the breeding birds is not
well-documented owing to the fact that the species is also transient
and a winter resident in the State.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Eastern Kingbird</b>: <i>Tyrannus tyrannus</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This summer
resident is common throughout the east; it is local in the west but
there maintains conspicuous numbers in favorable places, such as
riparian woodland; preferred habitat in eastern sectors is typically
in woodland edge. Temporal occurrence is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_13">Table 13</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding season.</i>&mdash;Sixty-three dates of egg-laying span the period
May 11 to July 20 (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>); the modal date for completion of clutches
is June 15. Nearly 70 per cent of all eggs are laid in June.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 3 eggs (3.3, 2-3; 10). Clutches are
probably larger than the average in May and smaller in June and July.</p>

<p>Nests are placed in crotches, terminal forks, and some on tops of

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;The available records of breeding by this
species in Kansas are too few to indicate reliably the span of the
breeding season. Information on hand suggests that Acadian Flycatchers
lay most eggs in late May or early June, and this places their nesting
peak some 10 to 20 days earlier than peaks for Wood Pewees and Traill
Flycatchers.</p>

(Oberholser) in the west.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Twenty-one records of breeding span the period
March 11 to June 10 (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>); the modal date for egg-laying is March
25. The histogram (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>) is constructed on a clearly inadequate
sample, and records of breeding both earlier and later are to be
expected. The peak of first nesting activity is probably reasonably
well-indicated by the available records.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 3 eggs (3.6, 3-5; 16).</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the ground, usually amid short vegetation such as
cropped prairie grassland or cultivated fields (notably soybeans and
wheat), and occasionally on bare ground.</p>

occurrence in the State is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_14">Table 14</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
<i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eight records of breeding span the period May 21
to June 20; the modal date for egg-laying is May 25. The small sample
may not accurately reflect the peak of nesting activity.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 or 6 eggs (5.5, 5-6; 4).</p>

<p>Nests are placed chiefly in abandoned woodpecker diggings in willows,
four to ten feet high, over water.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Bank Swallow</b>: <i>Riparia riparia riparia</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This summer
resident is common wherever cut-banks suitable for nesting activities
allow relatively undisturbed behavior. The species is almost always
found near water. Temporal occurrence is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_14">Table 14</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Sixty records of breeding span the period May 11
to June 20 (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>); the modal date for completion of clutches is June
5.</p>

<p>Nearly 75 per cent of all clutches are laid in the period May 21 to
June 10. Under unusual circumstances time of breeding can be greatly
delayed; such circumstances occurred in 1961 in many places along the
Kansas River in eastern Kansas, where the soft, sandy-clay banks were
repeatedly washed away in May and June by high water undercutting the
cliffs. Bank Swallows attempted to work on burrows in late May, but
stabilization of the banks occurred only by late June, and the peak of
egg-laying for many colonies was around July 12. Records for 1961 are
omitted from the sample used here (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (4.8, 3-7; 60). Yearly
clutch-size at one colony 3 miles east of Lawrence, Douglas County, is
as follows:</p>

<div class='center'>

</table>
</div>

<p>The sample for 1961 is that taken in early July when breeding occurred
after a delay of more than a month, as described above.</p>

<p>Nesting chambers are excavated in sandy-clay banks, piles of sand,
piles of sawdust, or similar sites, at ends of tunnels one to more
than three feet in depth from the vertical face of the substrate.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Rough-winged Swallow</b>: <i>Stelgidopteryx ruficollis serripennis</i>
(Audubon).&mdash;This summer resident is common in most places; it is not
restricted to a single habitat, but needs some sort of earthen or
other substrate with ready-made burrows for nesting. Temporal
occurrence is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_14">Table 14</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;The 14 records of breeding are in the period May
11 to June 30; the modal date of egg-laying is June 5. Seventy per
cent of all eggs are laid in the period May 21 to June 10.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (5.0, 4-6; 4).</p>

<p>Nesting chambers are in old burrows of Bank Swallows, Kingfishers,
rodents, or in crevices remaining subsequent to decomposition of roots
of plants; frequently this swallow uses a side chamber off the main
tunnel, near the mouth, of a burrow abandoned or still in use by the
other species mentioned above.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Cliff Swallow</b>: <i>Petrochelidon pyrrhonota pyrrhonota</i> (Vieillot).&mdash;This
common summer resident occurs wherever suitable sites for nests are
found. Temporal occurrence is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_14">Table 14</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;The 610 records of breeding span the period
May 21 to June 30 (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>); the modal date for egg-laying
is June 5, and 85 per cent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span>
of all clutches are laid from May 21 to June 10. Such
synchronous breeding activity is probably a function of strong
coloniality with attendant "social facilitation" of breeding behavior.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (4.9, 3-7; 7).</p>

<p>Nests are built in mud jugs plastered to vertical rock faces, bridges,
culverts, and buildings from a few feet to more than 100 feet above
the ground.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Barn Swallow</b>: <i>Hirundo rustica erythrogaster</i> Boddaert.&mdash;This summer
resident is common in most habitats, occurring chiefly about
cultivated fields and pastures. Temporal occurrence is indicated in
<a href="#Tbl_14">Table 14</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Sixty-three records of breeding in northern
Kansas span the period May 1 to July 31 (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>); the modal date for
completion of first clutches is May 25, and that for the second is
July 5. The schedule of breeding in southern Kansas (chiefly Cowley
County), to judge by 41 records, conforms to the one for northern
Kansas: the season spans the period May 1 to August 10, and the modal
date for first clutches is May 15. The ten-day lag in peak of first
clutches of the northern over the southern sample is about what would
be expected on the basis of differential inception of the biological
growing season from south to north each spring.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size does not vary geographically, to judge
only from the present samples, and all are included in the listing to
follow. The modal size of clutches is 5 eggs (4.7, 3-7; 43); clutches
from the period May 1 to 30 show an average of 5.0 eggs, from June 1
to 20 an average of 4.9 eggs, and from June 21 to August 10, 4.4 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are usually placed on horizontal surfaces in barns, sheds, or
other such structures; more rarely they are put on bridges, and less
frequently yet on vertical walls of culverts or sheds.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Purple Martin</b>: <i>Progne subis subis</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This summer resident
is common in the east but rare in the west. The only documented colony
west of the 99th meridian was in Oberlin, Decatur County (Wolfe,
1961), occupied some 50 years ago. Temporal occurrence is indicated in
<a href="#Tbl_14">Table 14</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;The breeding season spans the period May 11 to
June 20 (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>); the modal date of egg-laying is June 5, and 57 per
cent of all clutches are laid in the period June 1 to 10.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (4.2, 3-6; 33). Mean
clutch-size is 4.3 eggs in May and 4.2 in June. Adults tend to lay
clutches of 5 eggs and first-year birds clutches of 4. Replacement
clutches by birds of any age tend to be of 3 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are built of sticks and mud placed in cavities; in Kansas these
are almost always in colony houses erected by man. Use of holes and
crevices in old buildings is known to have occurred on the campus of
The University of Kansas in the nineteen thirties (W. S. Long, 1936,
MS), in Oberlin, Decatur County in 1908-1914 (Wolfe, <i>loc. cit.</i>), and
presently in Ottawa, Franklin County (Hardy, 1961).</p>

<p class="species"><b>Blue Jay</b>: <i>Cyanocitta cristata bromia</i> Oberholser.&mdash;This resident is
common throughout Kansas in woodland habitats. Most first-year birds
move south in winter, but adults tend to be strictly permanent
residents. Groups of ten to more than 50 individuals can be seen
moving south in October and north in April. All individuals taken from
such mobile groups are in first-year feather.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eighty-three records of breeding span the period
April 10 to July 10 (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>); the modal date of egg-laying is May 15,
and about 50 per cent of all clutches are laid in the period May
11-31.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>
<i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.1, 3-6; 15).</p>

<p>Nests are placed from eight to 70 feet high (averaging 24 feet) in
forks, crotches, and on horizontal limbs of elm, maple, osage orange,
cottonwood, and ash.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Black-billed Magpie</b>: <i>Pica pica hudsonia</i> (Sabine).&mdash;This resident is
common in western Kansas, along riparian groves and woodland edge.
Records of nesting are from as far east as Clay County. Wolfe (1961)
outlines the history of magpies in Decatur County as follows: the
species was purported to have appeared in rural districts near Oberlin
in 1918, but Wolfe saw the birds only by 1921, at which time he also
found the first (used) nests. The first reported occupied nest was one
in Hamilton County in 1925 (Linsdale, 1926). Earlier records, chiefly
of occurrence in winter, can be found in Goss (1891).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Fourteen records of breeding span the period
April 11 to June 20; the modal date for egg-laying is May 15.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;There are no data on clutch-size in Kansas;
elsewhere Black-billed Magpies lay 3 to 9 eggs, and clutches of 7 are
found most frequently (Linsdale, 1937:104).</p>

<p>Nests are placed from 10 to 18 feet high (averaging 13 feet) in forks
or lateral masses of branches in cottonwood, box elder, ash, and
willow.</p>

<p class="species"><b>White-necked Raven</b>: <i>Corvus cryptoleucus</i> Couch.&mdash;This summer resident
is common in western Kansas, probably occupying locally favorable
sites in prairie grassland and woodland edge west of a line from Smith
to Seward counties. The species is known to nest in Cheyenne, Sherman,
and Finney counties.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;There are few data from Kansas; Aldous (1942)
states that the birds begin activities leading to building sometime in
April in Oklahoma; the peak of egg-laying probably occurs in May,
which coincides with the records from Kansas.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Outside Kansas, this species lays 3 to 7 eggs;
these figures seem applicable to Kansas, where brood sizes are known
to run from 1 to 7 young.</p>

<p>Nests are placed about 20 feet high in cottonwood and other trees.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Common Crow</b>: <i>Corvus brachyrhynchos brachyrhynchos</i> Brehm.&mdash;This
resident is common in most of Kansas, but numbers are lower in the
west. Distribution in the breeding season is west at least to
Cheyenne, Logan, and Meade counties.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Sixty-nine records of breeding span the period
March 10 to May 31 (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>); the modal date for egg-laying is April 5,
and 60 per cent of all eggs are laid between March 21 and April 10.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.2, 3-5; 19).</p>

<p>Nests are placed about 20 feet high in crotches near trunks or heavy
branches of such trees as red cedar, elm, oak, osage orange,
cottonwood, honey locust, box elder, and pine.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Black-capped Chickadee</b>: <i>Parus atricapillus</i> Linnaeus.&mdash;This resident
is common north of the southernmost tier of counties, in forested and
wooded areas. <i>P. a. atricapillus</i> Linnaeus occurs chiefly east of the
98th meridian, and <i>P. a. septentrionalis</i> Harris occurs west of this;
a broad zone of intergradation exists between these two subspecies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
<i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Fifty-one records of breeding span the period
March 21 to June 10 (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>); the modal date for laying is April 15,
and 64 per cent of all eggs are laid between April 11 and 30.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (5.4, 4-7; 10).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in cavities about ten feet high (ranging from four to
20 feet) in willow, elm, cottonwood, honey locust, apricot, or
nestboxes placed by man.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Carolina Chickadee</b>: <i>Parus carolinensis atricapilloides</i> Lunk.&mdash;This
resident is common in the southernmost tier of counties, from Comanche
County east, in forest and woodland edge. Actual records of breeding
are from Barber and Montgomery counties.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;There are no data on breeding of this species in
Kansas.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 5 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed in cavities of trees.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Tufted Titmouse</b>: <i>Paras bicolor</i> Linnaeus.&mdash;This resident is common in
the eastern half of Kansas, in woodlands. Specimens taken in the
breeding season and nesting records come from east of a line running
through Cloud, Harvey, and Sumner counties, and the species probably
breeds in Barber County.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Twenty-two records of breeding span the period
March 21 to June 10 (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>); the modal date for laying is April 25,
and 54 per cent of all clutches are laid in the period April 11 to 30.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 to 5 eggs (4.5; 6).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in cavities about 12 feet high (ranging from three to
30 feet) in elm, oak, cottonwood, hackberry, redbud, osage orange, and
nestboxes placed by man.</p>

<p class="species"><b>White-breasted Nuthatch</b>: <i>Sitta carolinensis</i> Latham.&mdash;This resident
in eastern Kansas, in well-developed woodland, is uncommon. <i>S. c.
cookei</i> Oberholser occurs east of a line running through Douglas and
Cherokee counties, on the basis of specimens taken in the breeding
season and actual nesting records, and <i>S. c. carolinensis</i> Latham
occurs in Montgomery and Labette counties. <i>S. c. nelsoni</i> Mearns has
been recorded in Morton County but probably does not breed there.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid in March and April; young have
been recorded being fed by parents throughout May.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is between 5 and 10 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed in cavities about 30 feet high in elm and sycamore.</p>

<p class="species"><b>House Wren</b>: <i>Troglodytes aedon parkmanii</i> Audubon.&mdash;This summer
resident is common in the east and uncommon in the west. Preferred
habitat is in woodland, brushland, and urban parkland. House Wrens
arrive in eastern Kansas in the period April 3 to 27 (the median is
April 19), and are last seen in autumn in the period September 19 to
October 13 (the median is September 30).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;The 116 records of breeding span the period
April 11 to July 31 (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>); the modal date of laying is May 20.
About 45 per cent of all clutches are laid in the period May 11 to 31.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 7 eggs (5.8, 3-7; 20). Clutches laid
in May average 6.1 eggs (4-7; 14); those laid in June and July average
5.0 eggs (3-7; 6).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in cavities about ten feet high (ranging from two to
50 feet) in cottonwood, elm, willow, and a wide variety of structures,
mostly nestboxes, built by man.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Bewick Wren</b>: <i>Thryomanes bewickii</i> Audubon.&mdash;This wren is an uncommon
resident in Kansas, except for the northeastern quarter, in woodland understory
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>
and brushland. <i>T. b. bewickii</i> Audubon occurs north and
east of stations in Riley, Pottawatomie, Douglas, and Linn counties,
and <i>T. b. cryptus</i> Oberholser is found south of stations in Greeley,
Stafford, and Linn counties; a zone of intergradation occurs between
the two named populations. The species occupies marginal habitat in
most of Kansas and periodically is reduced in numbers by severe
winters.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Twenty-two records of breeding span the period
March 21 to July 10 (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>); the modal date for first clutches is

<p>Nests are placed in crevices about five feet high (ranging from zero
to nine feet) in trees (oak, cherry, and pear), boulders, and a wide
variety of structures, some of them nestboxes, built by man;
appropriation and modification of nests of Barn Swallows is known to
occur.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Carolina Wren</b>: <i>Thryothorus ludovicianus ludovicianus</i> Latham.&mdash;This
common resident of southeastern Kansas in woodland understory and
brushland is uncommon in the northeastern and south-central sectors.
Stations of breeding all fall east of a line running through Doniphan,
Riley, and western Reno counties. North and west of southeastern
Kansas the Carolina Wren is in marginal habitat and periodically is
reduced in numbers by severe winters.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Fourteen records of breeding span the period
April 11 to August 10; the modal date for laying is April 15, to judge
only from the present sample. The species probably breeds also in late
March and early April.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.2, 3-8; 9).</p>

<p>Nests are placed near the ground in stumps, and a wide variety of
structures built by man, or in crevices in earthen banks.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Long-billed Marsh Wren</b>: <i>Telmatodytes palustris dissa&euml;ptus</i>
(Bangs).&mdash;This is an uncommon summer resident in eastern Kansas in and
around marshes. Presumably breeding individuals occur east of stations
in Doniphan, Shawnee, and Sedgwick counties, but actual records of
breeding come only from Doniphan County (Linsdale, 1928:505). First
dates of arrival in spring run from April 19 to 29 (the median is
April 22), and dates of last autumnal occurrence are from September 26
to October 31 (the median is October 8).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid from May to August.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 or 6 eggs; the range is from 3 to
10 (Welter, 1935).</p>

<p>Nests are woven of broad-bladed grasses, usually no farther than two
feet from water or mud, suspended in vertical plant stalks or branches
in marshes.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Short-billed Marsh Wren</b>: <i>Cistothorus platensis stellaris</i>
(Nauman).&mdash;This rare and irregular summer resident in northeastern
Kansas occurs in wet meadowland. Breeding records are available from
Douglas and Coffey counties. Temporal occurrence in the State is at
least from April 29 to October 25; early dates are most likely of
transients.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid in late July and August.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 6 or 7 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are woven of plant fibers and placed in vertically-running
stalks and stems of grasses and short, woody vegetation, within two
feet of the ground.</p>

<b>Rock Wren</b>: <i>Salpinctes obsoletus obsoletus</i>
(Say).&mdash;This species is a common summer resident in western Kansas, in
open, rocky country. Specimens taken in the breeding season and actual
nests found come from west of stations in Decatur, Trego, and Comanche
counties. Dates of occurrence are from April 2 to October 25.
Autumnal, postbreeding movement brings the species east at least to
Cloud County (October 7, 8, and 12) and Douglas County (October 25).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Sixteen records of breeding span the period May
11 to July 20; the modal date for egg-laying is June 15.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (4.6, 3-7; 5).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in holes in rocks, occasionally in rodent burrows,
from ground level to 80 feet high on faces of cliffs, but there
averaging about 20 feet.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Northern Mockingbird</b>: <i>Mimus polyglottos</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This is a
common resident in parkland and brushy savannah throughout Kansas. <i>M.
p. polyglottos</i> (Linnaeus) occurs in the east, and <i>M. p. leucopterus</i>
(Vigors) in the west; a broad zone of intergradation exists between
the two. Most specimens from Kansas are of intermediate morphology.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Sixty-nine records of breeding span the period
April 21 to July 31 (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>); the modal date for first clutches is
June 5, but is weakly indicated in the histogram (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>).</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 3 eggs (3.5, 3-5; 27). Size of
clutch does not vary seasonally or geographically in the present
sample.</p>

<p>Nests are placed about four feet high (two to 10 feet) in osage
orange, red cedar, mulberry, scotch pine, catalpa, cottonwood, rose,
and arbor vitae.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Catbird</b>: <i>Dumetella carolinensis</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This is a common summer
resident in the eastern half of Kansas, but is local in the west, in
and near woodland edge and second-growth. First dates of arrival in
spring are from April 25 to May 14 (the median is May 6), and last
dates of autumnal occurrence are between September 20 and November 16
(the median is September 26).</p>

May 25, and 57 per cent of all clutches are laid from May 21 to June
10.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (3.3, 2-5; 43). Clutches laid
between May 11 and June 10 tend to be of 4 eggs (3.5, 2-5; 27), and
clutches laid between June 11 and July 31 tend to be of 3 eggs (2.9,
2-4; 16).</p>

<p>Nests are placed about four feet high in shrubs (rose, lilac, plum,
elderberry) and about seven feet high in trees (red cedar, honey
locust, willow, elm, apple, and in vines in such trees).</p>

<p class="species"><b>Brown Thrasher</b>: <i>Toxostoma rufum</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This is a common summer
resident in woodland understory, edge, and second-growth. <i>T. r.
rufum</i> (Linnaeus) occurs in eastern Kansas, to the western edge of the
Flint Hills, and <i>T. r. longicauda</i> Baird occurs west of stations in
Decatur, Lane, and Meade counties; the intervening populations are of
intermediate morphologic character. Some individuals overwinter in
Kansas, but most are regular migrants and summer residents, arriving
in spring from April 1 to April 25 (the

<p class="species"><b>Robin</b>: <i>Turdus migratorius migratorius</i> Linnaeus.&mdash;This summer
resident is common in the east, and is locally common in the west.
Some individuals, usually in small groups, can be seen throughout the
winter in eastern Kansas, and their presence makes it difficult to
document dates of arrival and departure of the strictly summer
resident birds; these can be said to arrive in March and to leave in
October, but these indications are the barest approximations.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;The 334 records of breeding span the period
April 1 to July 20 (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>); the modal date of laying of first
clutches is April 25, but subsequent peaks are indistinct. Nearly half
of all eggs are laid in the period April 11 to 30.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 3 eggs (3.6, 3-6; 57). Clutches laid
prior to May 10 average 3.6 eggs (3-6; 47), and those laid subsequent
to May 10 average 3.5 eggs (3-4; 10).</p>

<p>Nests are placed about 13 feet from the ground (ranging from two to 30
feet) in elm, ornamental conifers, fruit trees, cottonwood, mulberry,
walnut, hackberry, oak, ash, maple, osage orange, and coffeeberry.
Robins rarely nest in manmade structures, such as on rafters in sheds
and barns, on bridge stringers, and, exceptionally, on electrical
utility pole installations.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Wood Thrush</b>: <i>Hylocichla mustelina</i> (Gmelin).&mdash;This is an uncommon
summer resident in eastern Kansas, presently absent from the State
west of stations in Cloud and Barber counties. Preferred habitat is
found in understory of forest and woodland. Wood Thrushes appear to
have nested in small numbers as far west as Oberlin, Decatur County
(Wolfe, 1961), some 50 years ago, but have since disappeared from such
places, probably as a result
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>
of progressive modification of watershed and riparian timber by man. First
dates of arrival in spring are from April 19 to May 20 (the median is May 9),
and departure southward is in the period September 3 to October 1 (the median
is September 15).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Thirty-eight records of breeding fall in the
period May 11 to August 10 (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>); the modal date of egg-laying is
June 5 for first clutches. Fifty-five per cent of all eggs are laid
between May 21 and June 10.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 3 eggs (3.4, 3-4; 9).</p>

<p>Nests are placed about 11 feet high in elm, dogwood, willow, linden,
and oak.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Eastern Bluebird</b>: <i>Sialia sialis sialis</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This locally
common resident and summer resident in eastern Kansas, is only casual
west of Comanche County, in open parkland and woodland edge.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Fifty-four records of breeding span the period
April 1 to July 20 (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>); the modal date for first clutches is
April 25 and for second clutches is June 5.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (4.9, 4-6; 15).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in cavities about eight feet high in trees (elm, box
elder, fruit trees, willow, and ash), and about four feet high in
stumps, fence posts, and nestboxes placed by man.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Blue-gray Gnatcatcher</b>: <i>Polioptila caerulea caerulea</i>
(Linnaeus).&mdash;This summer resident is common in eastern Kansas in
brushy woodland, edge, and second growth. Specimens taken in the
breeding season and nesting records come from east of stations in
Riley and Cowley counties, but there is a breeding specimen from
Oklahoma just south of Harper County, Kansas. The species is present
from March 30 to September 18.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Twelve records of breeding span the period April
20 to June 20; the modal date for egg-laying is May 10.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 5 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed in forks or on limbs about 17 feet high in oak, elm,
honey locust, red haw, pecan, and walnut.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Cedar Waxwing</b>: <i>Bombycilla cedrorum</i> Vieillot.&mdash;This waxwing is a
rare, local, and highly irregular summer resident in northeastern
Kansas, in woodland and forest edge habitats. The known nesting
stations are in Wyandotte and Shawnee counties; six nests have been
found in the period 1949 to 1960. The species has been recorded in all
months.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid in June and early July.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 4 eggs (Davie, 1898).</p>

<p>Nests are placed four to 24 feet high in a variety of deciduous and
coniferous trees and shrubs.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Loggerhead Shrike</b>: <i>Lanius ludovicianus</i> Linnaeus.&mdash;This common
resident and summer resident favors open country with scattered shrubs
and thickets. <i>L. l. migrans</i> Palmer occurs in eastern Kansas, west to
about the 96th meridian, and <i>L. l. excubitorides</i> Grinnell occurs in
western Kansas, east to about the 100th meridian; populations of
intermediate character occupy central Kansas. These shrikes tend to be
resident in southern counties, but are migratory in the north. Dates
of spring arrival in Cloud County are between March 9 and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>
31 (the median is March 21) and the birds leave southward between October 19
and December 19 (the median is November 1).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Fifty-seven records of breeding span the period
April 1 to June 30 (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>); the modal date for egg-laying is April
15.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (5.3, 4-7; 32). There is no
seasonal variation in the sample.</p>

<p>Nests are placed about six feet high (ranging from four to 10 feet) in
osage orange, small pines, honeysuckle vines, and elm.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Starling</b>: <i>Sturnus vulgaris</i> Linnaeus.&mdash;This species is a common
resident in towns and around farms, foraging in open fields of various
kinds. Starlings (introduced into North America from European stocks
of <i>S. v. vulgaris</i>) first appeared in eastern Kansas in the early
1930s and were established as successful residents by 1935 or 1936.
Occupancy of Kansas to the west took only a few years. There are no
specimens taken in the breeding season or actual nesting records from
southwest of Ellis and Stafford counties; Starlings seem to be
resident in Cheyenne County, but no nesting record exists from there.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Sixty-seven records of breeding span the period
March 1 to June 30 (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>); the modal date for first clutches is
April 15, and for second clutches is June 5.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (5.2, 4-8; 19).</p>

<p>Nests are placed about 22 feet high (ranging from eight to 50 feet) in
crevices in elm, locust, hackberry, nestboxes placed by man, and in a
variety of other structures of man.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Black-capped Vireo</b>: <i>Vireo atricapilla</i> Woodhouse.&mdash;This was a summer
resident, apparently of limited distribution but in good numbers, in
Comanche County, in oak woodland and brushland edge. No specimens have
been taken in Kansas since 1885.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are probably laid in May and June. Goss
(1891:351) found a nest under construction on May 11, 1885, and this
is the only nesting record of the species in the State.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 4 eggs (Davie, 1898).</p>

<p>Nests are placed low, perhaps around four feet high, in deciduous
trees and shrubs (Davie, <i>op. cit.</i>).</p>

<p class="species"><b>White-eyed Vireo</b>: <i>Vireo griseus noveboracensis</i> (Gmelin).&mdash;This is a
local summer resident in eastern Kansas, in woodland and forest edge.
Stations of breeding occurrence are in Doniphan, Douglas, Johnson,
Anderson, Labette, and Montgomery counties. The species is present
within the extreme dates of April 23 to October 5 (<a href="#Tbl_16">Table 16</a>).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Ten records of breeding span the period May 10
to June 30; the modal date for egg-laying is June 10. The present
sample is not adequate to indicate extreme or modal dates with
reasonable accuracy.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (3.6, 3-4; 5).</p>

<p>Nests are placed relatively low in forks in trees and shrubs.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Bell Vireo</b>: <i>Vireo bellii bellii</i> Audubon.&mdash;This summer resident is
common in riparian thickets and second-growth scrub. Temporal
occurrence is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_16">Table 16</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
<i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Sixty-six records of breeding span the period
May 1 to July 20 (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>); the modal date for egg-laying
is May 25, and a little under 40 per cent of all eggs are laid in the period
May 21-31. Renesting following disruption of first nests is regular, and the
small peak in the histogram in the period June 11-20 is representative of this.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.6, 3-6; 21). Clutches in
May have an average of 3.7 eggs, and those in June and July 3.6 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed about two feet high (ranging from one to five feet)
in terminal or lateral forks of small branches in elm, hackberry,
osage orange, coralberry, dogwood, plum, honey locust, mulberry,
willow, cottonwood, and box elder.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Yellow-throated Vireo</b>: <i>Vireo flavifrons</i> Vieillot.&mdash;This is a rare
and local summer resident in deciduous forest and woodland in eastern
Kansas. Stations of breeding occurrence fall east of Shawnee and
Woodson counties. Temporal occurrence is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_16">Table 16</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid at least in May.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 4 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed 16 to 30 feet high in forks of mature deciduous
trees.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Red-eyed Vireo</b>: <i>Vireo olivaceus olivaceus</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This summer
resident is common in the east, but is local and less abundant in the
west, in woodland and deciduous forest. Temporal occurrence is
indicated in <a href="#Tbl_16">Table 16</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eight records of breeding fall in the period May
21 to July 31; most records of egg-laying are in the first week of
June.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.0, 3-5; 5).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in forks of mature deciduous trees, usually fairly
high&mdash;perhaps 15 to 25 feet (Davie, 1898).</p>

<p class="species"><b>Warbling Vireo</b>: <i>Vireo gilvus gilvus</i> (Vieillot).&mdash;This summer
resident is common in woodland and forest edge. Temporal occurrence is
indicated in <a href="#Tbl_16">Table 16</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Seventeen records of breeding span the period
May 1 to June 20, but it is likely that breeding later in June and
July will be recorded. The modal date for egg-laying is June 5, and
this seems to be a reliable index to the major effort in egg-laying in
spite of the small sample.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (3.6, 3-4; 5).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span> Nests are

<p class="species"><b>Black-and-white Warbler</b>: <i>Mniotilta varia</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This local and
uncommon summer resident lives in deciduous forest and woodland.
Specimens taken in the breeding season and actual records of nesting
come from Doniphan, Douglas, Coffey, Greenwood, Sedgwick, Labette, and
Cherokee counties. Temporal occurrence in the State is indicated in
<a href="#Tbl_17">Table 17</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid in May and June.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is around 5 eggs (Davie, 1898).</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the ground, in depressions or niches, under heavy
cover.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Prothonotary Warbler</b>: <i>Protonotaria citrea</i> (Boddaert).&mdash;This is a
local summer resident in eastern Kansas, in understory of riparian
timber and swampy woodland. Specimens taken in the breeding season and
actual records of nesting come from Doniphan, Douglas, Linn, and
Cowley counties. Temporal occurrence is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_17">Table 17</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Twenty-two records of breeding span the period
May 11 to July 10 (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>); the modal date for egg-laying is June 5,
and 75 per cent of all clutches are laid in the period June 1 to 20.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (4.5, 3-6; 15).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in holes and niches in willow, red haw, elm, and a
variety of stumps, about eight feet high (ranging from five to 20
feet), usually over water. A pair nested once in a gourd under the
eave of a house in Winfield, Cowley County, and another pair in a tin
cup on a shelf at a sawmill (Goss, ex Long, 1936).</p>

<p class="species"><b>Parula Warbler</b>: <i>Parula americana</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This summer resident
in eastern Kansas usually can be found in heavy woodland and
flood-plain timber. Specimens taken in the breeding season and actual
records of breeding come from Doniphan, Riley, Douglas, Montgomery,
Labette, and Cherokee counties. Temporal occurrence is indicated in
<a href="#Tbl_17">Table 17</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid at least from mid-May to mid-June.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 4 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed in debris in root tangles along stream banks, and,
presumably, in pendant arboreal lichens.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Yellow Warbler</b>: <i>Dendroica petechia</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This summer resident
is common in the east, in woodland and riparian growths. <i>D. p.
aestiva</i> (Gmelin) occupies eastern Kansas west at least to Barber
County, but it is not known how far west representatives of this
population breed. <i>D. p. morcomi</i> Coale breeds in western Kansas. <i>D.
p. sonorana</i> Brewster, a name applicable to Yellow Warblers of the
southwestern United States and northern Mexico, has been considered a
"straggler" (Long, 1940) or probable summer resident (Tordoff, 1956;
Johnston, 1960) in southwestern Kansas, on the basis of one specimen
taken on June 24, 1911, at a point two miles south of Wallace, Wallace
County. This specimen, which is pale, was identified in 1935 as <i>D. p.
sonorana</i> by H. C. Oberholser. Specimens taken subsequently from
Cheyenne, Hamilton, and Morton counties in the breeding season can be
referred adequately to <i>D. p. morcomi</i>. Probably the specimen of 1911
is a pale variant of <i>D. p. morcomi</i> within its normal distributional
range.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span> <i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Thirty-five records of breeding span the
period May 11 to June 20 (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>); this probably is inadequate to show
the extent of the season, and some egg-laying into July is likely to
be found in the future. The modal date of egg-laying is May 25, and
this is likely to be reliable.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.2, 3-5; 29).</p>

<p>Nests are placed about nine feet high (ranging from five to 20 feet)
in crotches of trees and shrubs including willow, elderberry,
cottonwood, crabapple, plum, and coralberry.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Prairie Warbler</b>: <i>Dendroica discolor discolor</i> (Vieillot).&mdash;This rare,
local summer resident occurs in deciduous second-growth. The only
breeding records are from Wyandotte and Johnson counties.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid at least in June.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 4 eggs (Davie, 1898).</p>

<p>Nests are placed low, perhaps about four feet high, in a wide variety
of small trees and shrubs.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Louisiana Waterthrush</b>: <i>Seiurus motacilla</i> (Vieillot).&mdash;This uncommon
to rare summer resident in eastern Kansas lives in woodland understory
near streams. Nesting records come from Douglas, Miami, Linn, and
Crawford counties. Wolfe (1961) reports he found a nest with young
near Oberlin, Decatur County, on June 10, 1910, under an overhanging
bank of Sappa Creek; Decatur County is some 250 miles west of the
present western limit of the breeding range of the Louisiana
Waterthrush, and western habitats are not favorable for their
occurrence. Temporal characteristics of their distribution are
indicated in <a href="#Tbl_17">Table 17</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid in May and June.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 5 eggs (Davie, 1898).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in concealed places in banks or stumps always where
it is wet.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid in May and June.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 or 5 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed near or on the ground, usually at the base of small
shrubs or clumps of grass.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Yellowthroat</b>: <i>Geothlypis trichas</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This summer resident
in and near marshes is common in the east and is local and somewhat
less common in the west. <i>G. t. brachydactylus</i> (Swainson) breeds east
of stations in Clay, Greenwood, and Montgomery counties, <i>G. t.

<p class="species"><b>House Sparrow</b>: <i>Passer domesticus</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This sparrow,
introduced from stocks in Ohio and New York (originally from England
and Germany), has been present since about 1876 in eastern Kansas; it
is a common resident in towns and at farmsteads throughout the state.</p>

<p>Nomenclaturally, House Sparrows in North America consistently have
been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span> referred to the European ancestral stocks, <i>P. d. domesticus</i>,
but none in North America today duplicates morphologically the
European birds. This is evidence of meaningful adaptation of the North
American populations to environments in which they now live, and
continued use of <i>P. d. domesticus</i> is misleading. Studies on local
differentiation in North American House Sparrows are in progress, and
when the biology of sparrows in the midwest is better understood,
suitable nomenclatural proposals will be made.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Fifty-one records of breeding span the period
March 20 to July 20 (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>); the modal date for laying of first
clutches is April 5, and for second clutches May 5.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (3.9, 3-7; 13).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in niches of various sorts seven to 50 feet high in
buildings, nestboxes, and trees, or freely situated in forks and
crotches of large trees.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Bobolink</b>: <i>Dolichonyx oryzivorus</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This species is a rare
and local summer resident, in and about grassy meadows. There are but
two stations of breeding in Kansas: Jamestown State Lake, Cloud
County, and Big Salt Marsh, Stafford County. Temporal occurrence is
indicated in <a href="#Tbl_18">Table 18</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid in June.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 5 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the ground amidst grasses.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Eastern Meadowlark</b>: <i>Sturnella magna</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This summer
resident and resident is common in eastern Kansas, in moist grassland.
<i>S. m. argutula</i> Bangs occurs in Montgomery, Labette, and Cherokee
counties and intergrades to the north and west with <i>S. m. magna</i>
(Linnaeus). Good numbers of birds are found east of the Flint Hills,
but to the west the species is of restricted and local distribution.
Extreme outliers of the species are found no farther west than
stations in Jewell, Stafford, and Barber counties.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Forty records of breeding span the period April
10 to July 20 (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>); the modal date for egg-laying is May 5.
Fifty-seven per cent of all eggs are laid in the period May 1 to 20.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (5.2, 4-7; 26). Prior to May
11, clutch-size is 5.3 eggs (13 records), and after that date it is
5.1 eggs (13 records).</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the ground, with cover of grasses or forbs.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Western Meadowlark</b>: <i>Sturnella neglecta neglecta</i> (Audubon).&mdash;This is
a common resident and summer resident in western Kansas, and is
restricted and local in the east; preferred habitat is in grassy
uplands.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Twenty-three records of breeding span the period
April 10 to July 30 (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>); the modal date for egg-laying is May 5
for first nests and June 5 for second nests.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.3, 3-6; 16).</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the ground with cover of grasses or forbs.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Yellow-headed Blackbird</b>: <i>Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus</i>
(Bonaparte).&mdash;This uncommon and local summer resident occurs chiefly
in the west, in marshes. Nesting records are from Wallace, Meade,
Barton, Stafford, Doniphan, and Douglas counties. Temporal occurrence
is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_18">Table 18</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Fifty-one records of breeding span the period
May 20<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span> to June 30; the modal date of egg-laying is June 5. The sample
is probably not large enough to be wholly reliable.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 4 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed within a few feet of water in cattail, rush, sedge,
and willow.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Red-winged Blackbird</b>: <i>Agelaius phoeniceus</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This is a
common summer resident in marshes, wet pasture, and scrubby parkland
throughout the State. <i>A. p. phoeniceus</i> (Linnaeus) occurs in most of
Kansas and <i>A. p. fortis</i> (Ridgway) occurs in the west, east to about
Decatur County. A few birds can be found in eastern Kansas in winter;
the full breeding population is present between April and October.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;The 109 records of breeding in Cloud County span
the period May 1 to July 30 (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>); the modal date for laying is May
25, and 71 per cent of all eggs are laid in the period May 11 to June
10. Eighty-eight records of breeding from northwestern Kansas make a
histogram almost exactly duplicating the one from Cloud County.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size at Concordia, Cloud County, is 4 eggs
(3.7, 3-5; 48); in northeastern Kansas mean clutch-size is 3.7 eggs
(3-5; 46). For the total sample, mean clutch-size in May is 4.0 eggs,
in June, 3.7 eggs, and in July, 3.3 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed about four feet high (one to nine feet) in willow,
cattail, sedge, grass, elm, exotic conifer, elderberry, coralberry,
buttonbrush, honeysuckle, smartweed, ash, osage orange, and yellow
clover.</p>

<p>In central Kansas red-wings are host to the Brown-headed Cowbird in a
frequency of one parasitized nest out of nine; in northeastern Kansas
the ratio is 1:25.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Orchard Oriole</b>: <i>Icterus spurius</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This summer resident is
common in parkland, woodland, and old second-growth. Temporal
occurrence is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_18">Table 18</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;The 118 records of breeding span the period May
11 to August 10 (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>); the modal date for completion of clutches is
June 5, and 45 per cent of all eggs are laid in the first ten days of
June.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.1, 3-6; 41). Clutches laid
at the peak of the season average 4.3 eggs (3-6; 26), and replacement
clutches average 3.8 eggs (3-4; 9).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span> Nests are hung about 15 feet high
(ranging from six to 55 feet) in elm, cottonwood, hackberry, locust,
catalpa, willow, alder, osage orange, walnut, pear, linden, and ash.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Baltimore Oriole</b>: <i>Icterus galbula</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This common summer
resident is most numerous in the east, in woodland and riparian
timber. The species hybridizes freely with the Bullock Oriole in
western Kansas, and individuals morphologically typical of Baltimore
Orioles are rare west of the 100th meridian. Evidence of such
hybridization can be found in specimens taken in eastern Kansas, but
the linear nature of distribution along water-courses to the west
restricts gene-flow, and evident hybrids are not yet conspicuous.
Temporal occurrence is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_18">Table 18</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eighty-three records of breeding span the period
May 11 to July 10 (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>); the modal date of egg-laying is June 5,
and 66 per cent of all eggs are laid between May 21 and June 10.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are hung about 24 feet high (ranging from nine to 70 feet) in
elm, cottonwood, sycamore, maple, and oak.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Bullock Oriole</b>: <i>Icterus bullockii</i> (Swainson).&mdash;This summer resident
is common in western Kansas in woodland and riparian situations. The
species hybridizes freely with the Baltimore Oriole, and most Bullock
Orioles in Kansas show evidence of such interbreeding. Almost all
records of breeding come from west of the 100th meridian, but the
species in recognizable form probably breeds locally at least as far
east as Stafford County.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Few nesting records are available, but these
suggest that the breeding schedule of the Bullock Oriole resembles
those of the preceding two species in Kansas.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 4 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are hung about 26 feet high (ranging from 10 to 50 feet) in
cottonwood, elm, and other large trees.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Common Grackle</b>: <i>Quiscalus quiscula versicolor</i> Vieillot.&mdash;This summer
resident is common in parkland, and around towns and farms. Most
individuals move out of Kansas in winter, and the temporal occurrence
of these birds is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_18">Table 18</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;The 233 records of breeding span the period
April 11 to June 30 (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>); the modal date for egg-laying is May 5,
and two-thirds of all eggs are laid between May 1 and May 20.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (4.5, 3-6; 33). Clutches laid
at the peak of the season average 4.7 eggs (3-6; 21), and those laid
as replacement clutches average 4.3 eggs (3-6; 12).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in forks and crotches about 22 feet high (ranging
from six to 50 feet) in elm, red cedar, cottonwood, oak, box elder,
and pine.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Brown-headed Cowbird</b>: <i>Molothrus ater ater</i> (Boddaert).&mdash;Many
individuals of this common summer resident overwinter in the southern
part of the State and it is difficult to determine dates of arrival
and departure in Kansas. Conspicuous abundance in the north covers the
period April to October.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;The 141 instances of egg-laying span the period
April 21 to July 20 (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>); the modal date of laying is May 15, and
53 per cent of all eggs are laid in the period May 11 to June 10.
Inception of laying is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span> here fairly reliably indicated, but in
exceptionally early springs laying does occur earlier; a few eggs were
found on April 6, 1963, too late for incorporation into this report
other than in this sentence.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size in cowbirds is not readily determined.
On the basis of ovarian examination of five females taken in
mid-season, the birds here lay about five eggs at a time. There is no
question that the birds are "double-brooded" in Kansas, and the season
is sufficiently long for as many as five "clutches" to be laid by a
given female.</p>

<p>Eggs are laid in nests of some forty species of birds in Kansas; 39 of
these are passerines. No preference for any one species is detectable;
the most frequently parasitized species are simply the common species,
and these are the kinds for which nesting records are easily gathered
by man. In the following list of host species, the names marked with

bottomland timber. Specimens taken in the breeding season and records
of nesting come from Clay, Doniphan, Douglas, Wyandotte, Johnson, and
Linn counties, but the species probably occupies the entire eastern
third of the State. Dates of arrival in spring are from April 29 to
May 25 (the median is May 11), and dates of departure in autumn are
from August 4 to September 23 (the median is August 10).</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Six records of breeding fall in the period May
11 to June 20.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 4 eggs.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 4 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are situated ten to 20 feet high on horizontal limbs of large
trees.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Cardinal</b>: <i>Richmondena cardinalis cardinalis</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This

meridian; west<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span> of this line the species becomes local and uncommon to
rare. Habitat in the east is found in woodland, edge, second-growth
and open riparian timber, and in the west the species is restricted to
riparian growths, chiefly along the Republican, Solomon, Smoky Hill,
Arkansas, and Cimarron rivers, and their larger tributaries.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;The 117 records of breeding span the period

a local and at times common summer resident in eastern Kansas, in
woodland, edge, and riparian timber. Specimens taken in the breeding
season and actual records of breeding come from Clay, Riley, Doniphan,
Leavenworth, and Douglas counties. This species meets and hybridizes
with the Black-headed Grosbeak west of the Flint Hills. Temporal
occurrence in the State is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_19">Table 19</a>.</p>

<p>Nests are placed in deciduous trees, in forks and crotches six to 30
feet high.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Black-headed Grosbeak</b>: <i>Pheucticus mehnocephalus melanocephalus</i>
(Swainson).&mdash;This summer resident is common in western Kansas, chiefly
along streams. Individuals referable to this species by sight records
alone breed in fair numbers as far east as Cloud and Sedgwick
counties, but to the east of these stations numbers are reduced,
partly as a result of presumed competition with the Rose-breasted
Grosbeak. Hybrids between these two grosbeaks are regularly produced.
The easternmost record of breeding by this species is at St. Mary's,
Pottawatomie County, where a male was seen as probably mated with a
female Rose-breasted Grosbeak. Temporal occurrence is indicated in
<a href="#Tbl_19">Table 19</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Sixteen records of breeding span the period May

<p class="species"><b>Indigo Bunting</b>: <i>Passerina cyanea</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This summer resident
is common in mixed-field and heavy brushland habitats. The species
extends westerly, in riparian situations, in reduced numbers,
ultimately meeting and hybridizing with the Lazuli Bunting. Specimens
referrable to the Indigo Bunting have been taken as far west as Finney
County, but most specimens from that far west show evidence of
interbreeding with Lazuli Buntings. Temporal occurrence is indicated
in <a href="#Tbl_19">Table 19</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Twenty-four records of breeding span the period
May 11 to August 20 (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>); the modal date for egg-laying is June
15.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 3 eggs (3.1, 2-4; 17).</p>

<p>Nests are placed about three feet high (ranging from one to nine feet)
in coralberry, sumac, thistle, sycamore sprouts, hickory sprouts,
grape, elderberry, cottonwood, dogwood, ragweed, and grasses.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Lazuli Bunting</b>: <i>Passerina amoena</i> (Say).&mdash;This uncommon summer
resident of western Kansas occurs in edge habitats and streamside
thickets. The one breeding record is from Morton County, and there is
a breeding specimen taken at Sharon Springs, Wallace County. The
species hybridizes with the Indigo Bunting in the western half of the
State. Temporal occurrence in spring is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_19">Table 19</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid in June and July.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 4 eggs (Davie, 1898).</p>

<p>Nests are placed a few feet from the ground, probably much as are
nests of the Indigo Bunting.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Painted Bunting</b>: <i>Passerina ciris pallidior</i> Mearns.&mdash;This is an
uncommon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span> summer resident in the southeastern third of Kansas, in edge
habitats and streamside brush. Specimens taken in the breeding season
and actual nesting records come from Douglas, Shawnee, Geary, Barber,
and Crawford counties. Temporal occurrence in spring is indicated in
<a href="#Tbl_19">Table 19</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid in June and July.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 4 eggs (Davie, 1898).</p>

<p>Nests are placed in deciduous shrubs and trees.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Dickcissel</b>: <i>Spiza americana</i> (Gmelin).&mdash;This species is a common
summer resident in eastern Kansas and is local and irregular in the
west, in grassland habitats. Temporal occurrence is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_19">Table 19</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Forty-one records of breeding span the period
May 1 to July 10 (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>); the modal date for egg-laying seems to be
May 5, but the curiously abrupt inception of breeding described by
this sample suggests that more records are needed to document fully
the breeding schedule of this species. Breeding in April almost
certainly will be found.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 4 eggs (4.1, 3-5; 14).</p>

<p>Nests are placed about two feet high (ranging from ground level to 12
feet) in grasses, osage orange, sedge, box elder, honey locust,
clover, thistle, and blackberry.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Pine Siskin</b>: <i>Spinus pinus pinus</i> (Wilson).&mdash;This irregular summer
resident occurs locally north of the 38th parallel, chiefly around
planted conifers. Known stations of breeding are in Hays, Ellis
County, Concordia, Cloud County, and Onaga and St. Marys, Pottawatomie
County.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Twelve records of breeding span the period March
11 to May 20 (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>); most nests have been established in late April
or by early May.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 4 eggs. Of ten nests examined
for eggs, five had at least one egg of the Brown-headed Cowbird; if it
is assumed that each cowbird egg replaced one of the siskins, mean
clutch-size is 3.7 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed about seven feet high (ranging from 3.5 to 13 feet)
in red cedar, exotic conifers, and Lombardy poplar.</p>

<p class="species"><b>American Goldfinch</b>: <i>Spinus tristis tristis</i> (Linnaeus).&mdash;This
resident is common in woodland edge, scrubby second-growth, old
fields, and riparian thickets. Occurrence tends to be local and at low
density in the southwestern sector.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Twelve records of breeding span the period June
20 to September 10 (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>); the modal date for laying is August 5.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.4, 3-6; 8).</p>

<p>Nests are placed from two to eight feet high in woody or herbaceous
vegetation.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Red Crossbill</b>: <i>Loxia curvirostra</i> Linnaeus.&mdash;This is an uncommon and
irregular winter visitant to Kansas, but it nested once in Shawnee
County. <i>L. c. minor</i> (Brehm), on geographic grounds, probably nested
here, but five other subspecies have been recorded in the State and
any one of these might have undertaken the aberrant breeding.</p>

<p><i>Breeding record.</i>&mdash;Three eggs, set completed March 24, 1917, Shawnee
County; successfully fledged (Hyde, 1917:166).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span> The species usually
lays 4 eggs and places its nests in conifers.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Rufous-sided Towhee</b>: <i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus erythrophthalmus</i>
(Linnaeus).&mdash;This is an uncommon summer resident in eastern Kansas, in
understory of woodland and streamside timber. Specimens taken in the
breeding season and actual records of nesting come from east of
stations in Cloud, Marion, and Cherokee counties. Temporal occurrence
is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_20">Table 20</a>; records of <i>P. e. arcticus</i> (Swainson) have
been eliminated from the sample as far as has been possible.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Nineteen records of breeding span the period
April 21 to August 10 (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>); the modal date for egg-laying is May
5.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.0, 3-7; 14).</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the ground, in heavy cover.</p>

ordinarily a common summer resident in western Kansas, in grassland
and open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span> scrub. Specimens taken in the breeding season and all
breeding records except one for western Franklin County come from west
of stations in Decatur, Ellis, and Comanche counties. Irregular
fluctuations in breeding density have been recorded from Decatur
County (Wolfe, 1961). Temporal occurrence is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_20">Table 20</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Fourteen records of breeding span the period May
21 to June 20; the modal date of egg-laying cannot be determined from
the present sample.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.1, 3-5; 7).</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the ground, at bases of clumps of grasses.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Grasshopper Sparrow</b>: <i>Ammodramus savannarum perpallidus</i>
(Coues).&mdash;This species is a local and at times common summer resident
throughout Kansas, in grassland. Temporal occurrence is indicated in
<a href="#Tbl_20">Table 20</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Seven records of breeding fall in the period May
1 to June 30; the modal date of laying seems to be about May 21.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 5 eggs (4.8, 4-5; 5).</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the ground or in low vegetation, with cover of
grasses or forbs.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Henslow Sparrow</b>: <i>Passerherbulus henslowii henslowii</i> (Audubon).&mdash;This
is an uncommon and local summer resident in eastern Kansas, in
grassland. Breeding records are from Cloud, Shawnee, Douglas, Morris,
and Anderson counties. Temporal occurrence is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_20">Table 20</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are laid in May and June.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is about 5 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed on the ground, usually in bluestem pasture, but in
any case grasses.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Lark Sparrow</b>: <i>Chondestes grammacus</i> (Say).&mdash;This is a common summer
resident in grassland edge habitats. <i>C. g. grammacus</i> (Say) breeds
east of the Flint Hills, east of stations in Pottawatomie, Anderson,
and Montgomery counties, and <i>C. g. strigatus</i> Swainson breeds west of
stations in Clay, Dickinson, Harvey, and Sedgwick counties; specimens
from the intervening area are of intermediate subspecific character.
Temporal occurrence is indicated in <a href="#Tbl_20">Table 20</a>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Thirty-nine records of breeding span the period
May 1 to July 20 (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>); the modal date for egg-laying is probably
May 25, but the sample may not be reliable in this respect.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.1, 3-5; 28).</p>

<p>Nests are usually placed on the ground, in cover of pasture grasses,
clover, thistle, milo maize, and soybean; there is one record of a
nest one and one-half feet high in a small pine.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Cassin Sparrow</b>: <i>Aimophila cassinii</i> (Woodhouse).&mdash;This is a common
summer resident in open scrub and grassland edge, to the south and
west of Wallace and Comanche counties. Specimens taken in the breeding
season and actual nesting records are from Wallace, Hamilton, Kearny,
Finney, Morton, and Comanche counties; the A. O. U. Check-list (1957)
cites Hays, Ellis County, as a breeding locality, but it is doubtful
that the species now occurs there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span> <i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Eggs are

<p class="species"><b>Chipping Sparrow</b>: <i>Spizella passerina passerina</i> (Bechstein).&mdash;This is
an uncommon summer resident in open woodland, second-growth, and edge.
<i>S. p. passerina</i> is found east of stations in Barber and Shawnee
counties; Chipping Sparrows are not known to breed farther to the
west, but records for north-central Kansas are likely to be found. The
subspecific affinities of our Chipping Sparrows are entirely with the
nominate subspecies, and there is no basis for earlier reports (Long,
1940; Tordoff, 1956; Johnston, 1960) that <i>S. p. arizonae</i> Coues (=
<i>S. p. boreophila</i> Oberholser) occurs in Kansas.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Nine records of breeding fall in the period May
1 to May 10, in no way indicating the whole span of the breeding
season; the species probably lays eggs in May and July, as well as in
June.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs.</p>

<p>Nests are placed four to 40 feet high in evergreens of a variety of
kinds.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Field Sparrow</b>: <i>Spizella pusilla</i> (Wilson).&mdash;This species is a common

(Wilson) breeds in eastern Kansas chiefly east of the Flint Hills; <i>S.
p. arenacea</i> Chadbourne breeds in central and western Kansas,
intergrading easterly with <i>S. p. pusilla</i>.</p>

<p><i>Breeding schedule.</i>&mdash;Twenty-nine records of breeding span the period
April 21 to September 10 (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>); the modal date for first clutches
is May 5.</p>

<p><i>Number of eggs.</i>&mdash;Clutch-size is 4 eggs (4.1, 3-5; 21).</p>

<p>Nests are placed about 10 inches high (ranging from ground level to
three feet) in or among coralberry, osage orange, elm, oak, rose, and,
once, peony.</p>

<p class="species"><b>Chestnut-collared Longspur</b>: <i>Calcarius ornatus</i> (Townsend).&mdash;This was
formerly a summer resident in western Kansas, in short-grass habitat.
The only known nesting area was in the vicinity of Ft. Hays, Ellis

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
